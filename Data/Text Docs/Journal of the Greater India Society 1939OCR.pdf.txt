Early Traces of Buddhism in Burma

Pa

ww irom the earliest times to the introduction of

- Theravada Buddhism in Pagan in 1057).

By Dr. Niwar-RANJAN Ray.

The story of the introduction of Theravada Buddhism in
Pagan in Upper Burma after the conquest of Thaton by.
king Anawrahta is well known to all students of Indo-
Burmese history and culture. It occurred in the third quarter
of the eleventh century, in 1057, to be more exact, when
Pagan was fast rising into importance. The year 1057, if
we are to believe our available sources, is indeed a signi-
ficant date in the history of Burma; it marks the starting
be point of authentic Burmese history. Before this date there
is hardly any exact history of the Peninsula; available
records speak but very little of the activities of its people
prior to this date, and even the scanty information that can
be gleaned with difficulty are so wrapped in mist and woven
with myths that a reconstruction of the history of that period
means but a careful knitting together of some hypothetical
guesses confirmed in a very few. instances by literary or |
archaeological evidences. From the Burmese point of view |
there is in fact little importance attributed to the period
prior to Anawrahta’s conquest of Thaton ; local chronicles

of which we have a very good number from about the
fifteenth century onwards dismiss the pre-Pagan period of
their accounts in one or two chapters which are but com-
posed of hazy and indefinite half-historical, half-legendary
tales thinly interspersed with stray notices of happenings
unconnected with one another. The information supplied
is meagre, and the sources for the chroniclers who sat down
at a much later period to record them down must have
been still more so. Events of great importance must have
taken place, and the course of history must have been as
vigorous and as full of life as it was afterwards, but our
sources have hardly any record of them except in stray and

meagre, often unintelligible, references. Butitis asif by a’

magic touch that the situation changes with that memorable
year of 1057. With the occupation of the Pagan throite by
Anawrahta the chronicler becomes infused as it were with
new life, his account becomes fuller with details, events
_ begin to move with force and vigour, the narrative becomes
- more vivid, lively and continuous, information more def-
nite, and his chronicle comes to stand against a more or less
reliable backeround.. It is from this date that the chroni-
cles seem.to give us a more or less exact history of the
Peninsula in matters political, religious and cultural.
Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton (1057) is described in
some detail in all the standard chronicles as well asin the
Sdsanavamsa; and is rightly given the importance it
deserves. The long Kalyani inscriptions however make
a short reference, but the reason is obvious, for king
Dhammaceti’s primary object was to record the history of
the Reformation of the Order by himself, and everything
else was of secondary importance, coming in only as an
introduction to his own great work. The successful march
‘on Thaton is viewed with importance by all later chroniclers,
not so much for the actual conquest of the Talaing country
and assertion of Burmese supremacy, as for the introduction
of Buddhism in its. purest form into Upper Burma and the
consequent beginning of actual intercourse of Upper Burma
Sees

with the outside world. The introduction of the new religion
produced a general. outburst of faith, and kings and minis-
ters, rich and poor, queens and maids, nobles and commons >
vied with one another in devoting themselves to works of
merit, and to the erection of sacred edifices of diverse
plans and styles which stand to this day; in various stages
of decay, as silent witnesses to the religious spirit that
pervaded the whole country. It is therefore very interest-
ing to read in the chronicles the rapid and dramatic march
of events which led to this great awakening of faith and
enthusiasm.
Shin Arahan was a young Talaing monk of Thaton,
well-versed in the sacred books of Theravada Buddhism.
Burning with the zeal of a fervent proselyte and with the i|
inteitt of preaching the Law to the people of ‘Tampadipa”™
he came to Pagan, and dwelt in a forest ‘not near not far’ :
from the capital. One day he was brought to the capital
before Anawrahta, the then reigning monarch of the realm |
Deo of Pagan.
(yi ere And Anawrahta said, “Master, of what race art
thou? Whence comest thou? Whose doctrines dost thou
follow?’ And Shin Arahan made answer ‘My race is that of
the Lord Buddha, possessor of the nine qualities beginning
with sanctity, the six glories beginning with Lordship, and
afl the four incomprehensible beginning with intuition. Thou
sayest, whose doctrine do I follow? I follow the doctrine of
the sermon of authority, most fine, subtle, difficult and

profound, preached by the Lord—the Lord Buddha.” And

if 1. According to a-seventeenth century inscription, quoted by
Burmese diplomatists in negotiation with the British Government and
) translated for his Government by Colonel Burney, at that time
_ Resident at Ava, Tampadipa included the districts of Pagan, Ava,

p. 746).

4 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

the king was full of joy and rapture, and spake again,
entreating him, ‘My Lord, preach me somewhat—yea, but a
little—of the Law preached by the Lord, the Master.” And
Shin Arahan preached the Law.......when he had made an
end of preaching the king spake again: ‘Where is my
Master, the Lord—the Lord Buddha? How much is the
sum of the Law preached by the Lord? Liveth there any
disciple and son of the Lord save thee, my Master?’ ”’

_ To all these Shin Arahan made adequate and satisfactory
replies.

‘‘And when Anawrahtaminsaw heard the words of
Ashin Arahan, he was seized with an ecstasy of faith
unbounded, and he said, ‘Master, we have no other refuge
than thee! From this day forth, my Master, we dedicate
our body and our life to thee! And Master, from thee |
take my doctrine!’ And he built and offered him a monas-
tery in the forest......When the king and all the people
forsook their own opinions. and were established in the
good Law, the Ari lords lost their gain and honour and bore
great hatred against Shin Arahan. And the king fearing
that the Ari would practise ill against him, took good heed
and appointed guards enough to defeat the thirty Ari lords
and their sixty thousands disciples. At that time there
came many saints and novices from Thaton, and made
saints and ghostly counsellors of those who were faithful in
the religion..."" (Glass Palace Chronicle, pp. 73-75)

: But the religion that Shin Arahan had introduced could
not thrive, there being no sacred text in Pagan, for ‘without
the scriptures there can be no study, without study there
can be no intuition.” But where were the scriptures to
come from? And Shin Arahan said ‘In the country of
Thaton are thirty sets, the three Pitakas in each set. There
are also many sacred relics!’. So Anawrahta sent a wise
minister with a store of gifts and presents to Manuha, the
_king of Thaton, to beg of him’ certain sacred texts and
relics. But Manuha grew jealous, and ‘answered ill’: ‘‘It
is not seemly to send the three Pitakas and the relics to
EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 5

such as you, who hold false doctrines—even as the fact of
the maned lion can be kept in a bowl of gold and not ina
vessel of clay." It was a direct hint at Anawrahta’s
former patronage of the Samanakuttaka heresy, and an
insulting refusal. Anawrahta grew furious and marched on
Thaton with a huge force on land and sea, and laid siege
to the city. The rest of the story is briefly told. Anawrahta’s
men captured Manuha with his family and ministers who
were all taken captive to Pagan. But Anawrahta’s objective
was still something more than Manuha himself or his king-
dom, he wanted scriptures, and learned teachers to explain
and preach all that was contained in them. He therefore
“brought away the sacred relics which were kept in a
jewelled casket and worshipped by a line of kings in
Thaton; and he placed the thirty sets of Pitakas on the
king’s thirty-two white elephants and brought them away...
Moreover; to the noble Order acquainted with the books of
the Pitakas he made fair appeal and brought them away.’”
Manuha was perhaps at first treated with consideration and
allowed to pass the rest of his days at Myinkaba, in the
outskirts of the royal capital, where he built two temples,
the Nanpaya which contains his throne room, and the other
named and still known after him where there is a colossal
figure of the Buddha entering the parinirvdna. Later on,
Anawrahta seems to have dedicated him and his family as
slaves to the Shwezigén pagoda, thus rendering them
outcast for ever.*

Shin Arahan had now got all that he wanted to have,
and his mission received, as a result, a wonderful fillip. He
had now at his service a large band of monks devoted to
his cause, anda library of sacred texts’ at his disposal.
The abominable Aris—the heretic Samanakuttakas, as the
Sdsanavamsa would call them—were already at bay; the
king with his counsellors and ministers had already been
won over; and the fleld was ready for the Arhantato sow
his seeds. And he lostno time. With the king and the
court behind him and all the resources they could com-
mand, with the services of a devoted band, but above
everything, with the zeal and fervour of a preacher and
reformer andthe willto win, his work of propagation of
the sacred religion of the Sakyamuni went apace till within
a very short time he had won thousands of converts to his
side. Hundreds came forward to receive ordination, and
entered the sacred Order, burning with the zeal and
enthusiasm of new converts. At the head of them all, to
guide them all was Shin Arahan, the primate of a kingdom
daily growing and expanding.

Soe much for an account of the story of the introduction
of Theravada Buddhism in Pagan in upper Burma. From this
account it is evident that in the middle of the eleventh cen-
tury Theravada Buddhism had a very flourishing existence in
the Ramafifiadesa, the land par excellence of the Talaings;

Manuha, king of Thaton, to the Shwezigon....... If Manuha was so
dedicated his grandson would not have been married to king Narapati’s
daughter.’ The Sasanavamsa too seems to suggest that; Manuha (or
Manohari) was not ungenerously treated by Anawrahta, (pp. 63-64)
See also Forchammer’s Report, Jan., 1891, pp. 7-8.

5. The Scriptures that were brought from Thaton were all
housed by Anawrahta in a library hall specially built for the purpose.
This building known as the Bidagataik (== Tripitaka taik or Tripitaka
library), an edifice of wooden origins, stands to this day amidst the

jungle of ruins of Pagan.

and its capital Thaton® “in the land of Thudammawadi
(=Sudhammavati)’’? swarmed with hundreds of monks who
lived in monasteries that must have housed libraries
containing not only the books of “‘the Three Pitakas but
also the Four Books of Divination’’®

lessees And the king of Arimaddanapura, having
possession of king Manuha, took away the saintly monks,
who were full of learning and piety; he took away the
monks who knew the Three Scriptures and the Four Books
of Divina tiger: ane took them all to the land of Arimaddana
(Pagan).”

Moreover, the kings of Thaton were

‘famous and mighty kings, and who upheld the
religion of the Lord; all the people followed the command
of almsgiving and all other commands of righteousness.’'**

There werein Thaton also different orders of monks
besides the one to which Shin Arahan himself belonged.

‘*And thou hast asked—Is there any monk of the Order,
save myself, a disciple of the Lord? Yea, verily; besides
myself there are the Paramattha Order and Samuti Order.’”**

Pali as the language of the religious texts must have
been known there and understood by the entire body of
monks and atleast by a section of the lay people; Pali
literature, mainly canonical and commentarial, was also
presumably more or less widely read. It is evident that this
reputation of Thaton as a centre of the religion of the
Buddha was not built ina day; it must have taken some-
time to be able to share the glory she owned with Kajfici-

puram and Kaveripattanam in South India on the one hand
and Ceylon on the other, which incidentally, were the three
other contemporary centres of Theravada Buddhism. We
may, therefore, start with the assumption that Theravada
Buddhism was introduced into Suvannabhiimi, the land of
the Mons or Talaings, at least several centuries earlier, and
gradually established itself not only at Thaton, but also at
other places in Lower Burma.

But at the same time it must also be borne in mind that
all our sources of information regarding Anawrahta’s sack
of Thaton and consequent introduction of Theravada
Buddhism in Upper Burma—the Kalyani inscriptions, the
Hmannan and other Burmese chronicles—belong to a much
later date. In fact the Kalyani inscriptions are the earliest
dateable record alluding to this important historical event,
and these inscriptions cannot be dated earlier than the [5th
century. In recent years quite a large number of inscrip-
tions from Pagan in Mon, Pyu and Burmese and dateable
from the 10th to the 14th century, have been discovered
and deciphered, and it is strange that not even one of them
contains any reference to this important and glorious histori-
cal event—glorious from the Pagan point of view. Indeed
the omission is so significant as to lead one to doubt the
authenticity of the whole story as contained in the later ins-
criptions and chronicles. No dialectical ingenuity is good
and convincing enough to explain the silence of the host of
contemporary and almost contemporary records of Pagan
kings and the nobility to whose credit must have been due
the vigorous religious and cultural drive that we witness in
Pagan during the reign of the Anawrahta dynasty. Yet one
must account for the deluge of lithic records pervaded by
the unmistakable spirit of Buddhism, the countless number
of temples, stipas, monasteries, all dedicated to that noble
faith and containing images of gods and goddesses belonging
to the Buddhist pantheon, that suddenly begin to crop up
at Pagan onwards from the eleventh century. One cannot
help feeling that this sudden outburst must have been due

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 9

to some outside contact, some achievement that brought
Pagan in touch with the march of a civilised and cultured
life unknown to these northern barbarians who had swooped
from their hilly retreats on to the torrid plains of the upper
Irrawady. And strangest of all strange things, the Pagan
records do not make any mention of any such contact, any
such historic upheaval, and pity it is that one has to fall
back upon an explanation contained in records that are
at least four centuries later than actual events. But it
is almost impossible not to admit that these records, though
late, offer on the whole a trustworthy and perhaps convin-
cing explanation.

The problem ahead

The difficult but interesting question now arises: When
did Lower Burma, the land of the Pyus, and of the Mons,
adopt for the first time the faith of Theravada Buddhism,
and which are the traces of its footprints during its course
through centuries since its first adoption in the Peninsula ?
Are we to accept or reject the tradition, so insistent in
Burma, of the Asoka mission of Sona and Uttara to Suvan-
nabhiimi? Should we rely or not on the later tradition that
makes Buddhaghosa, the celebrated Buddhist encyclo-
paedist, a monk of Thaton which he is said to have made
the centre of his missionary activities in the Peninsula, or
credits him to have brought a complete set of the Buddhist
scriptures from Ceylon to Thaton in the 5th century A. D. ?
Have there been brought to light any new facts or factors,
hitherto unknown, that prove; more or less definitely, the
existence of Theravada Buddhism in any part of Burma
prior to the middle of the eleventh century >? It is on a
satisfactory answer to these and other similar questions that
depends the reconstruction of an account of the early
history of Buddhism in Burma. | shall therefore proceed
to examine one by one such. facts and problems as may
be expected to throw some light on our subject of investiga~

The method followed

In trying to find answers to the questions just stated the
method will be to trace our steps backwards. We shall
first try to find the state of Buddhism in the first half of the
eleventh century in the neighbouring kingdoms of Thaton,
e.g., in Pegu, and then tracing backwards try to establish
from archzeological evidences, the existence of the Religion
in the old kingdom of Prome from c. 600 to 900 A.D. Our
next step will be to further corroborate the fact of the
flourishing existence of the religion in the kingdom of
Prome during this period with the help of Chinese literary
evidence of more than one source. We shall next try to
push the story of the religion earlier still and establish from
epigraphical evidence of most definite and unquestion-
able character, that Buddhism in its most abstruse doctrinal
and philosophical aspects was known and practised in the
capital of Prome as early asc. 450 A.D. This will natur-
ally lead us to an examination of the Buddhaghosa tradition
which is even to-day very strong in Lower Burma, and which
does not seem altogether inadmissible. Our next step will
lead us earlier still, to the middle of the 3rd. century A. D.,
when Buddhism was being practised in a country known in
almost contemporary Chinese chronicles as Lin-yang
which | propose to identify with a place in Burma. My
final step will be to examine the tradition of the Asoka-

mission of Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhiimi in about

250 B.C. The conclusions I shall arrive at will be summa-
rised at the end of the chapter.

I
BUDDHISM IN Peau, c. 1000-1050.

The account of the conquest of Thaton, as we have just
seen, is evidence enough of the very flourishing existence
of Buddhism in the middle of the eleventh century in the
realm of king Manuha where presumably the religion had

_ been in practice for a very long time. Equally flourishing

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 11

condition seems to have prevailed in the neighbouring king-
dom of Pegu. But Buddhism was not the only religion in
the realm of the kings of Pegu, as it was neither in Thaton.
Brahmanical Hinduism was a strongrival in Thaton as well
as in Pegu and elsewhere, where it sometimes claimed
homage and patronage from the reigning kings ; and the
two religions at times even came into conflict with one
another. The tradition of such a conflict is preserved in
the Slapat Rajawan, a local Burmese chronicle. There is
much of legendary element in the story which I reproduce
at some length below, but to any careful reader its historical
value is obvious. The story which relates itself to king
Tissa of Pegu, assigned according to local or Burmese
reckoning to the middle of the eleventh century (1043-57),
affords a key to the position of Buddhism in Pegu during
his reign, and shows how it was sometimes persecuted;
but that is obviously an attempt of the chroniclers who
were all Buddhists of a much later date at proving the
superiority of the religion they themselves professed.

‘STissa was a heretic king of Pegu. He... made no
obeisance to Buddha, to the Law he hearkened not, he
honoured the Brahmanas. He threw down the images of
the Buddha and cast them away into ditches and marshes.

“Now there was a certain merchant’s daughter who
clung to true religion. Bhadradevi was this maiden’s name.
From her tenth year she went out to listen with her parents
and hearkened continually to the Law. She had exceed-
ing great joy in the Three Gems (Triratna). Daily she said
the Three Names of Refuge (Buddha, Dhamma, Samgha)
with care. And it came to pass that the time when she was
in her first youth was the time when the king cast down the
images of the Buddha. At that time the maiden went down
to bathe, and by chance. she thrust her hand against an
image of Buddha. And she drew it up and it glistened
with gold. She asked, ‘who has caused this image to be
cast away?’ And the old slave-woman made answer, ‘Lady,
this king follows the word of false teachers. Verily it is

nessa

12 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

the king who has caused this image of Buddha to be cast
away? Whoever greets, honours or bows before Buddha
at the pagodas, him the king causes to be slain and to be
brought to naught’. Thus said the slave-woman, When
the maiden had heard their words, she spake on this wise,
‘I obey the Three Gems. I can endure death. First wash
the image clean, then set itup at a pagoda.’ She herself
and the slave-woman washed it and set it up at a pagoda.
‘‘Now as she was setting up the image, these things were
told to the king. And he sent runners to call her. The
maiden, that ring adorned with gems beyond price, spoke to
the king's runners saying, ‘Let me abide here before the
image.’ And she made haste to wash every image of
Buddha as many as were there, and to set them up every
one. And, after a time he sent more runners. When the
maiden came before him, she spake unto him. But he
listened with anger and spake in this wise, ‘Take her to the
elephants that they may trample her to death.’ Then the
maiden caused gentleness to soften the king and the
elephants and the elephant-men, and continually she said, ‘I
take refuge in the Lord’ and she called on the Three Names
of Refuge. And the elephant dared not tread on her, but he
roared with his voice, neither could the elephant-men make
him run at her.........50 men told the king in fear. When the
king heard these things, he spake in this wise, ‘Cover her
with straw for the funeral pyre. But the maiden caused gen-
tleness to work again, and she called on the Three Names of
Refuge. Men stirred themselves to burn her, yet she burn-
ed not. So they told the king in fear. Thus spake the
king, and he said, ‘O maiden, when I see the image of

-Buddha, thy teacher fly up into heaven, then mayest thou

live. But if from the image of thy teacher there fy not up
seven images, eight images, | will have thee cut into seven
pieces.” And he had her led.to the foot of the ditch......and

_ she prayed on this wise, ‘O image of the Lord of Bliss! I,

thy hand-maiden, set up thy images. Buddha is lord every-

where, his Law is lord everywhere, his Samgha is lord

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 13

everywhere. As Buddha, his Law, his church are every-
where lord, so may eight images of Buddha fly up into
heaven at the king's hall.’ And in the twinkling of an eye
there flew eight images up into heaven...towards the king’s
hall. And the maiden returned and pointed it out to the
king......Then said the maiden ‘O earthly king, Buddha
my teacher is gone to Nirvana. Thou hast been able
to see only his images fly up into heaven in his stead. Thou
hast followed false teachers and called them better. Let
thy hand-maiden see them fly up.” Then the king com-
manded them to fly. But the false teachers could not fly.
And the king drove them away...and he caused the maiden
to bathe, and he raised her to be his chief queen...... and he
returned thanks and followed true religion over after.’’??

Thenceforth Tissa became a faithful follower of Buddh-
ism and proved himself to be a patron of the Faith. Here
is another passage, from another chronicle:

‘‘ln Benares land there was an ancient pagoda on the top
of the river Ganges’ bank. When the bank was washed away.
men picked up the relics and holy images that had been
enshrined there, and gave them to their children to play, for
there was no longer anyone to worship them. Now Nga
Dula, a ship’s captain, saw this, and he thought, ‘The folk
of the east country deem these images divine and worship
them. | shall get gain if I sell them to the folk of east
country,’ So he bought them for a fitting price and came
with them to the landing stage at Pegu.....-..Men told king
Tissa....and he rewarded Nga. Oaks richly and ennobled

BUDDHISM IN OLD Prome, C, 600-950

Archaeological Evidence.

It isa pleasure to turn from such hazy and indistinct
literary references of doubtful historical value to evidences
archeological which are more direct and definite. They
tend to prove that besides Thaton and Pegu, Buddhism was
an established religion also in the old kingdom of Prome.
Moreover, these evidences take us back at least four cen-
turies earlier than one thousand A. D. when we have more
or less definite evidence of the existence of Buddhism in
Pegu and Thaton.

Such archzeological evidences consist in a number of
ancient monuments, stiipas and rectangular temples, at
Hmawaa, a village full of ruins five miles to the south of the
modern town of Prome, anda good number of stone and
bronze images, inscribed terracotta votive tablets and reli-
quaries discovered at the same locality and belonging
definitely to the Buddhist creed. But before we can turn to
a consideration of these archeological documents it is
necessary to take notice of the few faint lines of political
history of the kingdom of Prome during the seventh, eighth,
ninth and tenth centuries to which period the large majority
of the monuments, sculptures, bronzes, terracotta tablets

etc., just referred. to, may’ be assigned, stylistically and

palzographically. |

Besides casual references in the chronicles of the T'ang
dynasty to the eighteen vassal states of Piao and thirty-two
different settlements (to which we shall have occasion to
‘refer in detail), there has been discovered at Hmawza a
number of epigraphs i in the little known Pyu language ins-
cribed on stone and earthenware funeral urns recording
the names of certain kings of Prome whose names end in
“‘varman’ and _ ‘vikrama.’ The first set of these names

were found recorded in.a number of inscriptions on several
wi, such urns recovered i in: Toll. 13 from an ancient vault near

the Payagi pagoda; these inscriptions record the names
of kings Siiriyavikrama, Harivikrama and Sihavikrama,
evidently of Hmawza, who ruled according to Dr. Blagden,
the learned editor of these inscriptions, presumably in the
seventh’ and eighth centuries A. D.** The second set of
names which, by the way, happens to be the names of a king
Sri Prabhuvarma and his queen Sri Prabhudevi were found
recorded in another one line Pyu epigraph inscribed around
the lower rim of a votive stiipa. This stiipa, it should be
mentioned, has another line of Pali inscription around the
rim of the top of the cover, in a script which has long been
recognised by M. Finot for the first time,’* to have very
close affinities with the Kadamba script (Kannada-Telugu,
according to Bihler) of South India, of the fifth and sixth
centuries of the Christian era. The significance of Pali
epigraphs in this particular script will be discussed ina
succeeding section; for the present we shall confine our-
selves to the importance of these Pyu epigraphs with
special reference to their bearing on the subject of our
study.

The name-ending ‘varman’ led M. Duroiselle very
naturally to surmise’ that the ruling dynasty or dynasties
apparently of Indian blood, had their original home some~
where in South India, evidently in the Cola-Pallava country
where royal dynasties with name-endings in ‘varman’ were
rather common; in fact, the kings of the Pallava dynasty
had their name-endings in ‘varman’. There were also
reasons for assuming that there were two ruling dynasties,
a ‘varman’ (e.g. Sri Prabhuvarman) and a ‘vikrama’ dynasty™4

their original home in South India. A long inscription, not

in Pyu or Pali, but in Sanskrit and interspersed with Pyu

words and phrases which are nothing but translations of the
Sanskrit version, in clear north-eastern Gupta Brahmi
script of about the sixthand seventh centuries was very
recently recovered from the ruins of the old city.*® This
record isimportant from more than one point of view,
supplying as it does a definite starting-point in the
political history of old Prome anda considerable amount
of information onthe contemporary history of Buddhism
in the capital city. Moreover, it contributes substantially
to the elucidation of the origin of the Pyu script.

It may now definitely be stated that the Pyu script is
nothing but a local adaptation of the Indian Brahmi script;
and so far as the evidence of the few inscriptions discovered
up to date may help us to ascertain, it seems that this
adaptation took place sometime about the fifth century
A.D.; for Pyu alphabets and numerals show a very close
resemblance with those of Brahmi of the Gupta period.
But itis not yet possible definitely to ascertain whether
it was the north-eastern or southern Brahmi that served as
the source for the newly-evolved script, though it may be
pointed out that the elongated character of the alphabets
is more southern than north-eastern.”

name-endings in “vikrama.” Cf. the nigamana of the Abhidhamma-
vatara of Buddhadatta who was a native of Uragapura (Uraiyur) and
flourished during the reign of king Acyutavikranta or Acyuta-vikrama.

A Buddhist Dynasty of Kings.

The epigraph alluded to above is inscribed on the four
sides of the pedestal of a torso of a Buddha image seated
in dhyGnamudraé and vajraparyanka attitude. Stylistically
the image is definitely of late Gupta tradition, and may
safely be ascribed to exactly the same period as determined
by the palesography of the inscription. The record in
beautiful Sanskrit verse seems to have been set up by king
Jayacandra Varman at the instance of his religious teacher
(Arya) with the express purpose of establishing and enhan-
cing peace, amity and good-will, it seems, between
Jayacandra Varman, the king, and his younger brother
(tasyanuja) Harivikrama who built two cities (puradvayam),
evidently side by side, and one for each, even in one day
(ekaikadivase). The import of the record allows us to
arrive at some tentative conclusions: first, there presumably
have existed some rivalry between the two brothers
Jayacandravarman and Harivikrama, and the elder
Jayacandravarman was advised to put an end to it by
providing two cities, one for each, from where they ruled,
probably side by side and contempeoraneously, so that there
could be no loss of peace and good-will between the two
brothers. Secondly, Jayacandravarman and Harivikrama
both belonged to one and the same dynasty, not to two
different dynasties by reason of their having had different
name-endings, though it is possible that they had branched
off in two different lines and ruled separately. There was
thus no ‘vikrama’ or ‘varman’ dynasty in Promeas hitherto
assumed. The different sets of names so far known of this
Indianised dynasty of Prome can be provisionally arranged,
in the light of the above assumption, in the following
way!

- Thirdly, the dynasty seems to have migrated not from
South India but from the north, more particularly from
north-eastern India. This is proved not only by the script
of the inscription which is north-eastern Brahmi of the
Gupta period, but by the art-tradition as well of the Buddha
image round whose pedestal the epigraph is inscribed, and
further by the Janguage and creed of the inscription. But
I must confess that this point cannot be pressed too far, in
view of the better and stronger possibility of a royal dynasty
having migrated from South India.

Fourthly, and this is important from our point of view,
the dynasty to which these ‘varman’ and ‘vikrama’ kings
belonged was evidently a Buddhist dynasty. This is proved
firstly by the Pyu inscription round the silver-gilt reliquary
sttipa, referred to above on which there are images repoussé
in high relief of the four last Buddhas, with their names ins-
cribed in Kadamba script, respectively below them.*’ They
are _Konagamana, Kakusandha, Kassapa and Gotama with
their attendants Kasab (Kassapa), Maulana (Moggalana),
Sari (Sariputta) and ......da (Ananda), the four disciples of
the Buddha. : It is significant that the names are given in
their Pali form, and that these names are followed by a short
extract consisting of what seems to be words taken from
Pali scriptures. The characters of the record suggest that the
source of inspiration'of the subject of the record was the
Pallava-Kadamba region of South India. Thisis also strik-
ingly: confirmed by a stylistic consideration of the images
moulded in high relief on the stipa; they belong to an

20. It is unfortunate that these inscriptions have not yet been
edited, nor. their contents made known in any detail, For short

 fotices, however, see An. RAS, 1926-27, p. 172-73:

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 19

art-tradition having remarkably Pallava affinities. A further
and more definite evidence of their cult is provided by the
Sanskrit inscription round the pedestal of the Buddha image
just referred to above. As the record was set up by the
king himself who chose the pedestal of a Buddha image for
inscribing his historic record, it may be assumed that
Jayacandravarman and his dynasty professed the Buddhist
faith. The kingdom of Prome was thus ruled over during,
roughly speaking, the seventh and eighth centuries by an
Indianised Buddhist dynasty of kings ; and it was presum-
ably under the aegis of this dynasty that the majority of
the monuments of the old capital of the Prome kingdom
were probably built, sculptures executed, bronzes cast and
terracotta tablets moulded.

Short Pali Epigraphs.

Among other Pali records relating to Theravada
Buddhism may be mentioned a few tablets in which is ins-
cribed the well-known Buddhist formula of the extolment
of the qualities of the Buddha beginning with ‘“‘iti piso
bhagavd araham...... etc.’’* Weshall see later on that
this formula is inscribed on a number of Pali records re-
covered from old Prome. Besides such records, there have
also been recovered from the debris of ruins of the old city
a small number of terracotta votive tablets with the popular
Buddhist formula ‘‘ye dhamma hetuppabhava...... etc.”
in Pali inscribed almost invariably in n&gari characters of
the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries. Such tablets with
the formula in Pali in similar characters but paleeographi-
cally somewhat later in date (belonging to the eleventh and
twelfth centuries) have also been picked up from the
ruins of old Prome and Pagan. But they all seem to have

21. For a short notice of these records, see ‘An. RAS, 1927-28,
p- 145. pee hes

20 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

been locally copied to order from Sanskrit originals. Of
such Sanskrit epigraphs recording the Buddhist formula in
nagari script we have literally a deluge both from old Prome
and Pagan as well as from other sites, for example, from
Sameikshe near Thazi. These tablets were generally depo-
sited, probably as relics inside the relic chamber housed
within the shrines and was also sometimes used by wander-
ing devotees as moving shrines, a practice still not unknown
among wandering preachers. Exactly similar tablets with
the Buddhist formula inscribed in Sanskrit have been found
in large numbers in eastern India, at Sarnath, Bodhgaya,
Nalanda and other places; and notin a few instances the
tablets found in Burma were bodily carried over by Indian
emigrants to Burma and by Burmese pilgrims who came to
pay homage at the sacred sites sanctified by association with
the Master.

This well-known and oft-quoted Buddhist formula, we
shall see later on, is also quoted as the opening extract in
two gold plates bearing Pali epigraphs and discovered at
Maunggan, near Hmawza. These epigraphs may palzo-
graphically be dated in the 5th-6th centuries A. D., and
here we find probably the earliest epigraphic record of the
formula in Pali, and perhaps the only genuine and in-
dependent reproduction of the formula in that language,
no doubt shorn of its context, otherwise than in the Vinaya
Pitaka™ where it is described to have been uttered in a two-
line verse in Arya metre by Assaji to Sariputta at which the
spotless eye of the doctrine of causation arose in the latter.””
Thus runs the verse:

Ye. dhammathetuppabhava tesam hetum tathagato aha

Tesaf ca ‘yo nirodho evamvddi mahdsamano ti

a2... P.T:S.-edn, Mabavegge 1-24, 2,

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 21

Of things that proceed from a cause, their cause the
Tathagata has spoken, and also the cessation which
is of them: thus is the teaching of the great Samana
or ascetic.

The formula does not occur anywhere else in the Pali
Pitakas: and in the Vinaya, the verse formula at least if
not the entire legend of Assaji and Sariputta which incor-
porates the verse, has been rightly suggested ta be a later
interpolation“? The Pali formula certainly corresponds
to the Sanskrit verse

Ve dharma hetuprabhava hetuntesém Tathagato

hydvadatiesafi ca yo nirodho evamvadi maha$ramanah
which is found not only in the Mahavastu (IIL, p. 461) but
at the end of almost all important Sanskrit Buddhist works of
the northern school, though it is dificult to trace in any
of these texts the legend of Aévajit and Sariputra. This
formula in Sanskrit, we have already pointed out, is also
inscribed in a number of Buddhist votive tablets and
images in north-eastern India. The verse formula, there-
fore, seems to have become more popular with the northern
Buddhists who hardly knew anything of the Aévajit-Sari-
putta story as the Pali Vinaya knows it.” This is indeed
curious, and somewhat difficult to explain. My suspicion
is that the formula originally arose in the northern school,
independent of any legend whatsoever, at least a few
centuries after Gotama the Buddha had lived and preached,
and was incorporated later on by pious editors Ee com-~

Davids, Sakya or Buddhist Origins, 1931, pp. 135-36. 7

26. The Mabavastu, a text of the Vinaya Pitaka of the Loko-
ttaravadins gives the story of the conversion of Sariputta and
Moggallina alles in the same way as that of the Pali Vinaya;. but
in the place of Assaji we have Bhikkhu Upasena at whose first words,
light entered Sariputta’s mind. Tt shows probably. how the Mabavastu
drew upon the earlier Pali Vinaya, j just a as the Pal Nidana Katha drew
also upon the same Pali Vinaya. a :

= NIFEAR-RANTAN RAY

pilers of the Pali canonical texts, into the Mahavagga
story of the conversion of Sariputta and Moggallina. This
explains to a certain extent, I think, the wide and immense
popularity of the formula with the northern Buddhists who
knew it, independent of any legend, as a versified expre-
ssion of the essence of the Buddhist doctrine or gospel of
causation.

All we have said above is by way of a digression, just
to ascertain the probable source of origin of the formula.
As to the formula in Pali as quoted in the Maunggan
plates, it is possible that it was reproduced directly from
the Pali Vinaya Piiaka for, other portions of the records
reveal intimate knowledge of the other two Pitakas as
well, and as the script is South-Indian, there is certainly
much to be said in favour of our assumption. But with
regard to the terracotta votive tablets of Old Prome and
Pagan on which the formula is inscribed, it seems that it
was, though the language is sometimes Pali, copied locally

to order, as already suggested, from Sanskrit originals
inscribed on similar tablets.

Buddhist sculpiures, etc.

Among other archeological documents of old Prome
that may more or less definitely be said to belong to the
Theravada faith may be taken into account some frag-
ments of stone sculptures depicting scenes from the life
of the Buddha. Such sculptures though not so numer-
ous, are nevertheless unearthed from time to time; and
some of them are really interesting from the view-point
of Buddhist iconography. One such is a scene carved on
a piece of stone representing. the well-known story of the
Buddha about to. partake of the food offered him by the
two merchants Trapusha and Bhallika which is detailed
not only in the Jatakas, but in the Mahdvastu and Lalita-
vistara as well. Following this story and connected with
it in an inseparable way is that of the four Lokapdla devas

sae f who brought four stone bowls from which the Master was _

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 23

to eat the feod offered by the two merchants. This story
is depicted in another relief in which the Buddha is repre-
sented as seated in bhimisparga mudr& ona lotus pedes-
tal, and on his left is placed what seems to be an alms-
bowl. He is flanked by four standing personages, two
on either side, and each of them holding a bowl in both
hands. Presumably they are the four Lokapdla devas in
the act of offering bowls to the Buddha.*® Whatalso seems
to be a Jataka story is represented on a plaque where the
main figure is dressed in crowns and armlets as a Prince
and is seated cross-legged on a lion throne with his hands
in dhy@énamudrad. He is flanked by two standing figures
turned towards him; that on the proper left is, as if it were,
in the act of Striking with a club held in both hands, the
other on the right seems to be scratching the prince's arm.
It is tempting to identify the scene as a representation of
the Mugherpakkha Jataka.*’ On another terracotta votive
tablet*® the Buddha is flanked by two figures on each side,
those to the right are in monkish dress, and to the left in
secular dress. Below them are represented six persons three
on each side of what seems to be the dharmacakra. Lower
below are two gazelles flanking the wheel of Law which
helps us at once to locate the scene at the Deer Park or
mrgadava of Benares; and if the five figures to the right
are all monks, the scene must refer itself to the story of
the first five converts of the Master, the Paficavaggiya
bhikkhus. There are also other fragments of stone and
terracotta which depict the main scenes in the life of the
Master. Such examples and numerous others mostly in
stone and terracotta which represent the Buddha in one
or other of his traditional mudras and dsanas and with or
without his disciples and attendants, may stylistically be said

to derive their inspiration from the familiar Gupta tradition
of eastern India, and ascribed on the same consideration
to a period ranging from the sixth to about the ninth century
of the Christian era. They are indubitable proofs of the
existence of Buddhism in the old kingdom of Prome during
these centuries. |

Some of the Buddha images in stone-~and there is a
good number of them, fairly large in size-are frankly
works of local artists and craftsmen. Such examples are
almost invariably seated in paryankdsana with the right
hand in bhimisparga mudra and the left placed on the lap
and holding an almsbowl. This limited and orthodox
iconographic type may perhaps be said to afford some argu-
ment for these images to be considered as belonging to the
orthodex or Theravada school, an assumption which is

supported not only by their facial and physiognomical fea-.

tures, distinctly local as opposed to Indian, but also by the
stylised rendering of the artistic and iconographic type
traditionally inherited from the Indian Masters. One such
image can still be seen carved in a large slab of stone”
(8’ 2” x 6’ 3” x 1’ 3”) in the Bebe pagoda which is a
small square building surmounted hy a pyramidal roof in
three stages superimposed by a sikhara. The Buddha is
seated in paryankdsana and is flanked by two figures seated
cross-legged with aureole round their heads, their hands
raised to the chest and clasped in adoration. They are evi-
dently disciples. But what is interesting in this piece of
sculpture is to see the Buddha's left hand, not the right, in
bhiimisparga mudra, arid the right placed on the lap and
holding the almsbowl. This one example is evidence
enough to show how the local craftsmen while translating on
stone the first lessons in iconography they received from
their Indian teachers made mistakes that cbviously the local
converts did not consider grave. Another example of

in these instances—may be seen sculptured in groups on a
large rectangular slab of stone®® from the Yahandagu
pagoda. Eight images here sit cross-legged in a row, all
with their right hand in bhimisparsa mudrd and the left
placed on the lap and holding an almsbowl. The schema-
tic curls of the hair are treated in mass; and the sanghdii is
indicated only by its edges as also by the fold treated in
mass that hangs from the left shoulder. Figures of Buddha
of similar iconographic type but belonging probably to a
different artistic tradition may be seen at the Lemyethna
temple, also another small rectangular structure whose roof
issupported by a heavy masonry four-sided pillar in the
centre. Facing the cardinal points there appear origin-
ally to have been slabs of stone, with figure sculptures
executed on them in bold relief, embedded in the square
pillar. Two only of these slabs, those on the south and
west, remain; that on the south bears on it an image of the
Buddha represented as seated cross-legged on a throne with
what seem to be three flower vases in front.** The sculpture
has suffered so badly that the image has lost its head, and the
two accessory figures flanking him, portions of their body
as well. The right hand of the principal figure is placed on
the right knee with the palm down and the fngers raised
upwards which probably suggests that it is in what may be
called varadamudrad. The standing figure on the right is
probably that of a male, and that on the left of a female,
but it is difficult toidentify them owing to their very bad
state of preservation. On the stone facing west the Buddha
is fanked not by two human figures but by two caityas, and
is provided with an aureole round the head. It is, moreover,
seated on a lotus throne ‘‘with the feet, not the legs, cross-
ing each other, thus showing the sole of one foot, that is the
right foot which is placed just above the other, instead of
both soles. The left hand is placed on the lap, but the

right hand instead of being placed over the right leg with
the fingers pointing to the earth and the palm inward, is
stretched out and placed over the right knee.”’"* Duroiselle
has rightly suggested an iconographical aflinity of this type
with the Buddha images of Amaravati in South India;** and,
I think, that his assumption is supported by artistic consi-
derations as well.

Buddhist monuments

Now, coming to a consideration of the monuments, we
can ascertain at once, from what we have just noticed, that
the Bebe, Lemyethna and Yahandagu temples were all de-
dicated to the worship of the Buddha, and judged from their
sculptures these temples cannot be assigned toa date later
than seventh century A. D. It is possible further to assume
tentatively from a consideration of the art and iconography
of the images that these temples were mainly patronised
by the followers of the Theravada school of Buddhism.
And, if the Pali stone inscription fragments found from the
debris of ruins of the railings and base of the Bawbawegyi
stiipa had originally formed part of monument itself, then
we can possibly count more or less definitely the
Bawbawgyi also as one of the many religious foundations
of the Theravadins at Hmawza. Other monuments such
as the east Zegu temple, the Mahtaw village stipa, the
Payagyi and Payma stipas, etc. were also definitely
dedicated to the worship of the religion of the Master.
The figure sculptures attached to such temples and
terracotta votive tablets recovered from the relic chambers
or from the debris of ruins of some of these temples are
definitely eee tradition, and not unoften have

inscriptions on them in early eastern ndgari characters. To
select one example at random, the main image (2’ 8’ x1’
614”) of the (east) Zegu temple is one of the Buddha seated
in cross-legged fashion with an aureole round his head. He
is flanked by two crownedand well-dressed figures—probably
Bodhisattvas—each carrying a cauri. The right forearm
which seems to have been in the attitude of preaching is
missing. as also the face; the palm of the left hand is,
however, placed on the knee. Below is the Wheel of the
Law flanked by two gazelles on either side of which are
two worshippers evidently in the attitude of adoration.
The scene probably relates itself to the dharmacakra
pravarttana at the Deer Park of Benares. This piece of
sculpture’* plainly derives its style from the familiar Gupta
work of Northern India. ‘‘It can hardly be assigned toa
later date’ says Sir John Marshall, ‘“‘that the seventh
century A. D., and may be earlier’

And, it is strange that from what have up-to-date
been recovered by research and exploration in inscriptions,
sculptures and bronzes from the site of the old capital, it be-
comes apparent that the relations of the Pyu kingdom with
north-eastern India were much more frequent than with South
India, and the influences from the former in art, icono-
graphy and religion much more overwhelming than from
the latter. This is a fact that has hardly yet been recog-
nised, and even as late as 1925, M. Duroiselle opined
that the school of sculpture at old Prome ‘was influenced
mostly by South India’.°° Though it is not the place to go
into a detailed discussion of the question, it should,
however, be pointed out that M. Duroiselle’s contention
is not borne out by the finds up tillnow made at Hmawza.
In fact, among sculptures of which a large collection has.
been made in recent years there is not more than a dozen
that may definitely be said to oe South-Indian in-

fluence whereas there has been picked up a countless
number of stone sculptures and terracotta tablets that
frankly derive their style from the familiar later Gupta
sculptures of north-eastern India. In inscriptions as well,
without in any way underestimating the value in this
respect of the Pali records in South-Indian script, one can
point out that the importance of the long Sanskrit inscrip-
tion recoverd from Kan-wet-khaung-kén and the number-
less votive tablets with Sanskrit epigraphs, all in north-east-
Indian script, is not much the less. A systematic study of
the monuments of Prome is yet to be made, but here also
as elsewhere, we may point out that not only the stiipas
like the Bawbawgyi but also the rectangular edifices like
the Bebe betray north-east-Indian traits as revealed
respectively in the contemporary Dhamak stiipa of Sarnath
and replicas of rectangular temples with sikharas sculptured
on some of the reliefs of Bihar and Bengal, no doubt of a
later date. |

The sculptures and monuments referred to above by
no means exhaust even a fraction of what the old site of the
ruined capital has yielded to archzeological research and
exploration. It has been possible for us to take notice of
only a few just to show that with very few lithic records
and reliable chronicles at our disposal, these sculptures,
bronzes, terracotta tablets and monuments constitute in
fact the main, if not the ‘only data for rewriting the very
little known account of the early history of Buddhism in
Burma. The main conclusion as revealed by a study of
these documents is now well determined, and it may be
stated that Buddhism during the several centuries from the
sixth to at least the tenth was a popular and flourishing
religion in the capital city of the old kingdom of Prome,
and obviously at. other centres of the kingdom as well,
expressing itself in numerous monuments, votive tablets
and images in stone and bronze, and deriving its inspira- .

tion not only from south India sed Sqm north-eastern India
as well. No tee sirnearere

BupDHISM IN OLD PromE (Contd.)
C. 675—700 A. D.

What we conclude from archeological evidence
is strikingly corroborated by Chinese literary sources
of the period. The most important evidence in this
respect is supplied by the itinerary of the celebrated
Chinese pilgrim I-ching. But it seems most unfortunate
to the student of the history of Buddhism and the different
Buddhist schools that this devoted scholar of the religion
who travelled from China to India via the ancient
kingdom of Srivijaya by sea, and spent twenty-five years
(671-695) abroad interesting himself in the study of
Buddhism could find no opportunity to visit any of the
regions bordering the sea-coast of Burma or situated at some
distance to the interior. Butif he could not actually visit
any country in Burma, as he could not also most of the
islands of the Malay archipelago and countries of Indo-
China of which he speaks nevertheless,*° he certainly took
pains to learn about the state of the religion in all
these countries lying to the east of the Bay. That he
succeeded at least to some extent is proved by a
note in his Nan hai chikuei nai fa ch’nan (ch. 1, £. 3,
verso). .

‘“‘At the (eastern) extremity (of the eastern frontier coun-
tries, i.e. East India) there is the so-called ‘Great Black’
mountain, whichis, |] think, onthe southern boundary of.
Tu-fan (Tibet, according to Takakusu). This mountain is
said to be on the south-west of Shu-Chuan (Ssu-Ch’uan)
from which one can reach this mountain after a journey of a
month or so. Southward from this and close to the sea-
coast there is a country called Sriksetra (Shih-li-ch'a-ta-lo) ;
on the South-east of thisis Lankasu (Lang-chia-shu) ; on
the east of this is Dva (ra) pati (She-ho-po-ti); at the extreme

east Lin-i. The inhabitants of all these countries greatly
reverence the three Gems (evidently the Buddha, Dharma
and Samgha). There are many who hold firmly to the
precepts and perform the begging dhiiia®’ which constitutes
a custom in these countries.’'*®

Of the countries alluded to in the above passage, Lin-i
has been sought to be indentified with Campa, She-ho-po-ti
with Dvaravati (mod. Ayuthia in Siam), Shih-li-ch’a-ta-lo

37- The begging dhiita is one of the thirteen dhétaries which are
enumerated in Pali in the following order:
a. Pamsakilikahgarn
b. Tecivarikaigam
c. Pindapatikahgam
d, Sapadanacirikangam (Begging from door to door)
e. Ekésanikangam
f. Pattapindikangam (Begging with a bowl)
g. Kbhalupacchabbattikangam
h. Arafitakangam
i. Rukkbamilikangam
j. Abbbokasikaigam
k, Sosintkangam
1. Yarbasanthatikangam
m. Nesajjikahgam

Of these Nos. d and f are not found in the Sanskrit list of
Dhiitangas (For Chinese counter-terms, see Takakusu, Ibid., pp. 56-57
Childers, Dhitaigam). I-ching’s reference perhaps includes all the
three kinds of begging.

38 Takakusu, Ibid., pp. 9-10; Pelliot, BEFEO., 1904, pp. 405-6;
Chavannes, Religicux Eminents, p. 58 n.

As to the state of the Religion in Lin-i, there is a further reference
in I-ching’s Record. (Takakusu, op, cit. p. 12): “Setting out from
Kwan-chou (Huan-chou), a district in ‘Annem, right to the south one
will reach Pi-king after a journey of rather more than half-a-month
on foot, or after only five ot six tides if abroad ship; and proceeding
till southwards one arrives’ at Campa ic. Lin-i. In this country
Buddhists generally belong to the Aryasammitinikaya, and there are
also a few followers af the Sarviistividanikiiya,

with Sriksetra or the old kingdom of Prome (whose capital
is represented bythe ruins of the village of Hmawza, 6
miles to the south of the present town of Prome), and
Lang-Chia-shu with the kingdom of Chia-mo-lang-chia or
Kamalanka of Hsiian-chuang.®® Of these, the identifications
of Lin-i, She-ho-po-ti {also mentioned by Hsiian-chuang as
To-lo-po-ti) and Shih-li-ch’a-to-lo are generally accepted,
the latter country having also been mentioned by Heiian-
chuang as situated to the north-east of Samatata by the
side of a great sea in a valley of mountains.”

But itis difficult to be equally definite with regard to
the one remaining identification, though Ihave elsewhere
sought to identify |-ching’s Lang-chia-shu or Lankasu with
the entire Tennaserim division (Sanskrit Buddhism in
Burma, pp. 24-29). It is generally assumed that I-ching’s
Lang-chia-shu or Lankasuis the same as Hsiian-chuang’s
Chia-mo-lang-chia or Kamalanka, the reason being that
Lang-chia-shu is placed by I-ching exactly in the same
relation to Sriksetra and Dvdravati (To-lo-po-ti) as Chia-
mo-lang-chia is placed by Hsiiang-chuang in relation to
the same two kingdoms (i.e. Sriksetra and Dvaravati).**

39 For these identifications, see, Takakusu, op. cit., pp. li-lu;
Phayre, History of Burma, p. 32; Beal, Buddbist Records of the
Western World, Vol. U, p. 200, n. 34; Chavannes, op. cit; sand above
all Pelliot’s “Deux Itineraires’ in BEFEO., 1904. :

40 Hsiian-chuang’s orientation of Sriksctra is evidently wrong;
“for it lies. far to the south-east, not to the north-east of Samatata.
The only solution that occurs to me is that Sriksetra means (as is)
not improbable), not the capital, but the kingdom presumably of the
Pyu; that at the time of Hsiian-chuang the Pyu kingdom extended,
not as Phayre conjectured; “for a few miles north and south of Prome,
but as in 806 A.D., over Upper Burma; and that the road into
Burma from Samatata started in a north-easterly direction, probably
leading through Manipur and joining the Kamariipa route detailed
by Chia Tin (785-805 A.D.)” (JBRS., XIV. IL p. 163).

41 “Thence north-east (ic. from Samatata) beside the great sca

There can thus be no objection to the two kingdoms
being the same; nor canthere be any apparent criticism
against their being identified, as both Phayre and Beal do,”
with Pegu and the deltaic region of the Irrawady. But as
Lang-chia-shu has been identified with a considerable
number of similar names found in Chinese and other
sources, possibilities of identification of the kingdom with
other regions in Indo-China have very naturally suggested
themselves, and it is dificult to ignore them. Itis pointed
out that Lang-Chia or Lang-chia-shu is mentioned several
times by I-ching asa port visited by the pilgrims whose
lives he records, on their way to India. To quote one such
passage:

Taolin, a Chinese pilgrim, was tossed on shipboard over
the seas of the south. He passed the pillars of Copper
and reached the kingdom of Lang-chia. He crossed the
kingdom of Ho-ling (Java) and traversed the country of the
Naked People (Nicobar).........After several years he
reached Eastern India, in the kingdom of Tan-mo-li-ti
(Tamralipti).’

Where is Lang-chia or Lang-chia-shu ?

It seems clear from this passage that I-ching’s Lang-
chia (-shu) ‘‘was onthe west coast of the Peninsula, on
the route somewhere between Aanam and Java ; and if

Dvaravati which is placed on the basin of the Mena 3 Pic
ching, when he sent his Lives of the Pilgrims back to China,

in a valley of the hills, is the kingdom of Shi-li-ch’a-ta-lo; thence to
the south-east, in a corner of the great sea is the kingdom of See
lang-chia; thence in the east, is the kingdom of To-lo-po-ti.” This
is from Hoiian-chuang's Records; ects it with that of I-ching
quoted above. :

had lived about eight years in the seas of the south,
mostly at Palembang. Could he have made any mistake
about the position of Lang-chia-shu......2 Or did he know,
without troubling to distinguish them, two kingdoms of the
name Lang-chia (-shu) the one somewhere in Tennasserim,
the other on the east side of the Peninsula south of the
Isthmus of Kra >? Or is I1-Ching here merely echoing
Hsuang-chuang, but substituting for Kamalanka (a name
unknown to him), one that was familiar, Lang-chia-shu,
without much regard for geographical accuracy ?’* These
are some of the very pertinent questions that have been
raised, and one has to think over them before he can hope
to come to a conclusion on this point.

Meanwhile, Lang-chia-shu has been taken to be iden-
tical with the kingdom of Lang-ya or Lang-ya-hsun which
is referred to in the Liang shu (ch. 54, £. 3 verso) and with
that of Lang-ya-hsii mentioned in connection with Ch’ang
Chun’s embassy to Ch’ih-t’u kingdom in 607-8 A.D. Pei
Shih, ch. £. 3 recto ; Sui shu, ch. 82. £. 1. verso)**.

Without going into the details of these texts which have
been ably weighed and considered by Chavannes, Schlegel,
Pelliot and Luce,*® it may be said that the position of
these kingdoms as described in the Chinese texts referred
to, seem to be quite in accordance with that of I-ching's
Lang-chia-shu, i. e. they were situated somewhere in the
east coast of the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus
of Kra in the southern sea. Furthermore, Lang-chia-shu

has also been identified with Ling-yu-ssfi-chia mentioned .

by Chau-ju-kua (1225)” as one of the fifteen dependencies of
San-fo- ch’i (Balouteags, syiaya:pamurate’) which again,

loeds thinks,** is the same as (a) llahgasogam of Tanjore
Tamil inscription of Rajendracola (1012-1042). and (b)the
Lénkasuka,a dependency of the Majapahit, mentioned in the
old Javanese poem Nagarakrtagama (I4th century). Pelliot
thinks that Lang-chia-su=Lang-ya-hsiu= Lang-ya-hsii=Ling-
ya-ssti (-chia) = Lénkauka were one and the same kingdom“
which he identifies with Tennasserim, Ferrand agrees with
him but further indentifies it with Ilaigasogam, the Locac
of Marco Polo® (end of the 13th century), and finally with
the Lang-saka, of an Arabic manuscript of the I6th cen-
tury, situated on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula.”*
He, therefore, fixes the position of the kingdom on the
Isthmus of Ligor. But Qcedés, while fnding in Lang-chia-
shu of I-ching, Lang-ya-hsiu of the Liang shu and the Lang-
ya-hsii of the Sui shu one and the same place, sees in
the llangasogam of Rajendracola’s inscription, the Ling-
ya-ssy-chia of Chau-ju-kua and the Lénkasuka of the
Nagarakrtagama quite a different place®*. He identifies
the former with Tennasserim just as Pelliot does, and the
latter with Gunong Jérai or Kedah Peak, in the south of
the Kedah state.

Lang-Chia or Lang-chia-su= mod. Tennasserim Division.

I have in short reproduced above the various identifica-
tions of I-ching’s Lang-chia-shu and the data on which
they are based. None of them evidently is free from
objections. Pelliot was obviously influenced by the fact
that I-ching located the kingdom south-east of Sriksetra
and west of Dvaravati which one cannot certainly ignore.
But I do not understand Ferrand’s arguments for placing

it on the Isthmus of Ligor ; his identification does neither
suit the statement that it was situated south-east of Sri-
ksetra and west of Dvaravati nor the fact which I-ching
elsewhere seems to indicate, according to some, that it
was on the opposite coast of the Peninsula somewhere on
the route between Annam and Java. The first identifica-
tion of Coedés is understandable but the distinction he
makes between the two sets of names is open to objections
which have been ably pointed out by Prof. Luce. For
the present, however, | am rather disposed to agree,
though it is not conclusive, with Pelliot, and identify
I-ching’s Lang-chia-shu with at least that portion of the
present Tennasserim division which extends from Tavoy to
Tenasserim i.e. the region watered by the Tenasserim river
which is really to the south-east of Sriksetra and west of
Dvaravati (in the lower valley of the Menam).** As for other
references by I-ching® to Lang-chia-shu, | think they can be
reconciled in the following way; the boats that carried the
Chinese Buddhist pilgrims kept generally to the coast line till
they passed Fii-nan (or Chen-la as it was then called)

53 JBRS., XIV. II, p. 168-169.

54 Personally 1 would like to assume that Lang-chia-shu was
ptactically identical with the entire Tenasserim Division of to-day
extending from Thaton to Tenassetim. The positon then of the
vatious kingdoms (not of the islands but of the continent) bordering
the southern seas may be stated briefly as follows: First, Shi-li-ch’a-
ta-lo or Sriksetra ic. the old kingdom of Prome of the P'tao or Pyu;
second, Lang-chia-shu or Chia-mo-lang-chia (Kamalanka) to the
south-west of Sriksetra and west of Dvaravati; third, She-ho-po-ti or
To-lo-po-ti (Dyareved) on the lower valley of the Menam in modern
Siam; fourth, P’an-p’an to the south of Dvaravati and south-west
of Lin-i (Campa) in a corner of the sea’; fifth, Chen-la or old Fu-nan
(Cambodia) to the east and south-east of P’an-p’an; and lastly, Lin-i
to the extreme east extending as far as the coast.

whence they did no longer follow the coast line, but favoured
by the current crossed the Gulf of Siam almost diagonally till
they came to anchor somewhere at the head of the Gulf
on the east coast of the Peninsula, whence they crossed
over to Ho-ling or Java, and thence via Nikobar to Tamra-
lipti. For the rest, we can safely assume that the
kingdom of Lang-chia-shu extended from coast to coast of
the Peninsula.

Accepting this identification for the present, we are
now in a position to use more or less definitely I[-ching's
data as to the state of Buddhism in the countries we are
concerned with in our present subject of study. Of the
various countries in Indo-China that practised Buddhism in
his time, one, i.e. Sriksetra is definitely included in Burma;
and the other also we have, for the present, identified with
a region that is included in the same country. According
to I-ching, ‘the inhabitants of both these countries greatly
reverence the Three Gems, and many of them hold firmly
to the precepts and perform the begging dhiita which
constitutes a custom in these countries’. That in one of
the two countries, namely, Lang-chia-shu, Chinese Buddhist
priests used to be received in those days with honour and
treated with a great deal of respect will be evident from
the two following passages which we quote on the autho-
rity of Chavannes:

I-lang, Chih-ngan and I-hsiian, three Chinese pilgrims,
having reached We-lei (a small sea-port west of Pakhoi in
Canton) sailed on a merchant  ship...... They passed
Fii-nan, and anchored in the country of Lang-chia-shu) ;
and were treated by the king of that country with ceremony
that is usually accorded to very honoured and distinguished
guests.°* oF . | |

Further, Tao-lin, another Chinese pilgrim, also visited
the kingdom of Lang-chia; he too was welcomed by the

56 Chavannes, Religiens eminents, p. 57:

~ oder

¢

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 37

king of the country with the greatest courtesy, and was
treated with utmost care and respect.””

lt now remains to be considered: to which school this
Buddhism of Sriksetra and Lang-chia-shu (in the 7th cen-
tury) really belonged? On this point, I-ching himself, I
think, gives us a very illuminating and a most definite
lead. He speaks of the four nikdyas or schools of Buddhism
in his time: the Aryamahdsanghika nikdya, the
Aryasthavira nikdya, the Aryamiilasarvastivada nikaya, and
the Aryasammiti nikdya, though ‘‘which of the four schools
should be grouped with the Mahayana or with the Hina-
yana is not determined.” In South India generally and
Ceylon exclusively ‘all follow the Sthavira nikdya, or
Theravada, which was certainly included in the Hinaydna.
Sammiti nikdya also evidently was a Hinayanist school.”
I-ching seems also to include the Sarvdstivdda nikaya in
Hinayana. For, when he speaks of the “Islands of the
Southern Sea; consisting of more than ten countries,
where the Maialasarvdstivdda nikdya has been almost
universally adopted,’’ he states rather baldly that ‘‘Buddhi-
sm is embraced in all these countries, and mostly the
system of the Hinaydna (Smaller Vehicle) is adopted except

in Malayu (Sri Bhoja=S:ri Vijaya=Sumatra) where there are .

a few who belong to the Mahayana (Larger Vehicle)’’ And
on this point I-ching certainly could not mis-state facts, for
he himself subscribed to the school of the Sarvastivddins.”

57 Ibid., p. 100. .

58 Hstian-Chuang, the older . pilgrim, definitely labels the
Sammitiya school as Hinayanist. Watters, Yaan Chwang, Il, pp. 178,
242, 246, 247, 249, 252, 256, 258, etc.

59 “In I-Ching’s time the Sarvastivada school flourished most
in North India and in Magadha in Central India, (MadhyadeSa) and
had also some followers in East and West; but was entirely absent
in Ceylon and had very few adherents in South India. No ‘other
school, so far as we can ascettain, ever flourished so widely as the
Sarvistivada, either before or after the seventh century; though its
adherents in India alone, in Hsiian-Chuang’s time were not so nume-

ee ener

38 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

This is more cleat in the statement he elsewhere makes :“‘In
Northern India (where ‘all belongtothe Sarvdstivdda nikdaya,
though we sometimes meet the followers of the Mahdsanghi-
kanikaya) and in the islands of the Southern seas they gene-
rally belong’to the HinayGna, while those in the Divine Land
or Red Province (meaning in both cases China) devote them-
selvs to the Mahaydna; in other places (obviously excluding
South India and Ceylon where Sthavira nikéya was followed)
some practise in accordance with one some with the other.’’®°
it, therefore, follows that I-ching considered, and rightly so,
Sarvastivdda nikaya as belonging to the Hinaydna, though he
does not expressly say so-

From I[-Ching’s clear and somewhat detailed account
of the distribution of the different schools of Buddhism, we
are thus, | think, in a position to presume that the two
countries of Burma (Sriksetra and Kamalanka or Lankasu),
where Buddhism was practised in his time, belonged to
the Hinayana which included not only the Theravada, or
Sthavira nikdya as I-ching calls it, but the Sarvdstivdda
nikaya as well. The prevalence of the latter sect may, in
our present state of knowledge, seem somewhat startling,
but, I think, we have somewhat independent evidence to

rous as those of other schools (JRAS., 1819, p. 420) Takakusu, op. cit.,
XXII.

60 I-ching’s line of distinction between the two Buddhist sys-
tems, Hinayana and Mahayana, is likely to be considered liberal from
the orthodox point of view. “Those who worship the Bodhisattvas
and read the Mahayana Sitras are called the Mabayanists, while those
who do not perform these ate called the Hinayanists. There ate but
two kinds of the so-called Mabayana: the Madbyamikas (of
Niigarjuna) and Yoga (or Yogacira of Asafiga). Ibid., p. 14-15.

Hotian-Chuang also very loosely distinguishes between the two,
though he had great personal leanings towards Mahayana. This
explains why he sometimes describes even the StBavira school as be-
ere to Meee See, Watters op. cit. II, pp. 136, 198, 234, 241,

prove its existence, at least in the capital of the Old Prome
kingdom in about the seventh and eighth centuries, and at
Pagan in the subsequent centuries, till the twelfth. As to
the prevalence of the Theravada, the Pali inscriptions found
at Hmawza and discussed in a succeeding section bear
ample and eloquent testimony.

BUDDHISM IN OLD PRoME  (contd.)

Evidence of T’ang Chronicles
C.800

But before we take leave of the valuable information
afforded by Chinese texts we have to consider one or two
relevant passages relating to the kingdom of P’iao (Pyu),
in about the ninth century, from the chronicles of the
T’ang dynasty of China (618-907 A. D.),°° so far as they
relate to our present subject of study. The Hsin-t'ang-
shu (ch. 222 C, £. 2 verso) mentions eighteen kingdoms as
vassal states of P’iao who are mentioned elsewhere in
the same chronicle as having thirty-two chief settlements
that were presumably distributed over the region extending
from at least the mouths of the Salween in the south to so
far north as to include the whole of Upper Burma®™’. The
capital of the P’iao or Pyus has long been successfully
identified with Hsiian-Chuaneg’s Shi-li-cha-ta-lo (Sriksetra)
or Prome; the evidence therefore of the T’ang chronicles
as to what they have to record as regards the religion of
the country is certainly of interest inasmuch as it follows
close upon that of Eeching.

‘When the P’iao King goes out in his palanquin, he
lies on a couch of golden cord. For long distances
he rides an elephant. He has several hundred
women to waiton him. The wall of his city built of

The annalist continues, ‘‘There is a huge elephant (or

image) a hundred feet high; litigants burn incense and
kneel before it, reflecting within themselves whether they
be right or wrong, and then they retire. When there is

can still be seen round the ruins of the city; and three of the four
pagodas at the four corners can perhaps be traced in the Bawbawgyi,
the Payagyi and the Pyama_stéipas.

64 This probably refers to the Brahmana court-astronomers whose
influence in the Buddhist courts of Indo-China was considerable.
They are again and again mentioned in Mon Inscriptions of the
1ith-13th centuries. It is not. improbable that the Buddhists had
some knowledge of astroriomical calculations learnt from the
Brahmana priests whose existence in the old capital of Prome during
these centuries is proved by the discovery of Brahmanical images,
mainly Visnuite. Ray, Brabmanical Gods in Burma, Calcutta, 1932.

any disaster or plague, the King also kneels before it and

The evident conclusion

The evident conclusion is that during the eighth and
ninth centuries Buddhism in the capital city of Prome con-
tinued as strong as ever, and claimed—this at least is the
impression one gets from the passage quoted above—the
large majority of the population, each individual member
of which was required to spend some specified years of
life as a monk, a custom that is still widely prevalent in
Burma. The reference to a hundred monastic establish-
ments need not be taken literally, but it certainly indicates
a flourishing state of the religion in the country where the
doctrine of ‘non-killing’ had taken so deep a root as not
to escape the notice of even foreign sojourners:

V
BupDHISM IN OLD Prome (contd.)

C. 400-C. 600 A.D.

It has been sought to prove in the foregoing pages that
Buddhism was already an established religion widely
followed and practised in the kingdom of Prome from
about 600 A.D. But it is possible to push the history of
Buddhism in this part of Burma back to at least one cen-
ury anda half earlier still. The evidence is epigraphic
and hence may safely be relied upon.

As early as 1897 there were discovered at Maunggan,
a small village close to Hmawza, two gold plates bearing
Pali epigraphs inscribed in characters that have long been
recognised as having a very close affinity with the Kadamba
script of the fifth and sixth centuries of the Christian era.
Each of the two plates contains three lines, they are in
perfect state of preservation, and the letters are so distinct
as to leave no room for doubt as to their decipherment.

They begin each with the oft-repeated Buddhist formula:
“Ye dhammd hetuppabhavd tesam hetu....... ete.’ but
differ in the text of the portions that follow®®. This will be
evident from the transliteration that follows of the two
plates and their translations: —

Translation

(1) The Tathagata spoke of the cause of things which
are sprung from cause. The Great Recluse also
spoke of the ceasing to be in respect of those very
things. So it goes: He the Divine Master is the
Elect worthy of honour

(2) The Supreme Buddha, endowed with self-mastery
and graceful department, well-gone, excelling in the
knowledge of the world, unsurpassed, the guide to
tameable persons, the Teacher of Gods and men, the
Fnlightened and Blessed One

(3) Well-propounded by the Master is the Doctrine,
producing effect here and now, having ‘‘come and
see’ for its motto, leading up towards the goal, (and)
to be experienced individually by the wise.

In the first plate there is, besides the well-known for-
mula, an enumeration of 19 categories of Saddhama; evi-
dently from the Abhidhamma, ina progressively numerical
order. These categories are separately alluded to or dis-
cussed in more or less detail, in most of the Abhidhamma
texts : but it is probably in the Vibhanga, one of the seven
books of the Abhidamma, that these categories, some of
them at least; if not all, are often alluded to and treated
in detail. Thus, to the elucidation of the four iddhipada,
the four satipatthdnd, the seven bhojjhangd, the four ariya-
saccdni, the five indriyani, the four Samappadhénd, the
aithangiko maggo, and the dasa (tathadgata) baldni, the
Vibhanga devotes: separate chapters or sections; and at
least in one place it enumerates some of the categories in a
progressively numerical order:

44 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

Calldro satippatthdna caitdro sammappadhdnd caltédro
iddhipada paticindriyani pafica baldni satta bhojjhanga ariyo
atthangiko maggo (Rhys Davids, Vibhanga, p. 372).

This plate may, therefore, roughly be said to consist of
a very short synoptical list of some of the contents of the
Vibhanga, a sort of ashort note to help the memory or to
serve asa guide to a teacher of the Religion.

The second plate begins in the same manner as the
first ; and to any student of P&Ali canonical literature it
will be evident that the first line is followed in the second
and the third by the well-known praise of the Triratna.
We may find it, for example, in the Puffidbhisandavagga
of the Anguttara Nikaya,*’ a book of the Sutta Pitaka, where
the continuity of the text in two lines, as in our plate, is
rather broken by an introductory and a concluding sentence
in each case. This will be clearly evident from the extract
we reproduce from the Anguttara:

Bawbawgyi Pagoda Stone Inscription

The most important Pali inscriptions of Hmawza were
discovered not earlier than twelve years later. In 1910-11
while clearing a small debris round the base of the Baw-

bawgyi pagoda were unearthed two fragments of a stone
inscription in Pali ; the third fragment completing the ins-

cription was found the year after close by the same spot.
The inscription was edited and translated for the first time
by Prof. L. Finot in his very interesting article already
referred to.°*

Evidently the next is something of the sort of a dis-

psychology. That it is an extract from a canonical text,
there can be no doubt, and Prof. Finot suggested” that it
might probably be an extract, not necessarily word for word,
from the Dhammasangani, a book of the Abhidhamma,
while M. Charles Duroiselle pointed it out’? to be an
extract from the Vibhanga, another book of the sanie
pitaka. That the subject of the text of our inscription

tted, but nowhere in the Dhammasangani the subject is pre-
sented in the way we have in the inscription. Duroiselle’s
suggestion seems rather to be more precise, though in that
case also the text of the inscription does not follow that of
the Vibhaniga. There in the first article of the Paccayédcca-
tukka section of the chapter on Paccayd Kdravibhanga, we
have a systematic classification and explanation of what is
called akusald dhammd. In that connection is explained
what is avijja@ and next in a graduated order, what is
sankhdara derived from‘avijjd, vififidna derived from sankhara
ndma derived from vififidna, chaldyatanam derived from
nama, phassa derived from chalayatanam, vedand derived
from phassa, taithd derived from vedand, upddanam derived
from tafiha and so on and so forth, till we finally come to
what is jardmaranam.”’ But what is most logically and
systematically set forth in the Vibhanga is treated in a most
cursory and careless manner in the stone inscription without
any logic whatsoever in the system of arrangement. Thus in
the very first line is set forth contact and the fact of coming
into contact (samphusitattam) which, in the Vibhanga, is
explained in connection with touch (phasso) that is derived
from the six organs of sense. Next we get the three
khandas or aggregates which are set forth in the Vibhanga
in connection with the explanation of néma that is derived
from vififidna. The reference (2nd line) to opinion (ditthi)
or quarrels of opinion (ditthivipphanditam) comes only in
connection with the elucidation of updGddnam that is derived
from tafihd. The references to touch (phasso) that is
derived from the six organs of sense (chaldyatana) and to
sensation (vedan@) that is derived from touch seem, how-
ever, tobe in order. But the list (3rd line) counting chain,
fever, inclination, etc. in a seriesis set forth in the Vibhanga
only in connection with the elucidation of what is called
updddnam that is derived from tafha. lt is thus evident
that the text of our fragments is nothing but a cursory and

indifferent note, loosely arranged, of an important article
of the Vibhanga. What purpose this or such notes served
or for whom these were intended is somewhat difficult to
ascertain; but, as | have already suggested, itis likely that
these short epigraphs, by way of very short notes of essen-
tials of the Religion, served the purpose of a guide book,
a book of points to help the memory, for those preachers
of the faith who early took upon themselves the task of
evangalizing the land of Suvannabhimi.

A Gold-leaf Pali Manuscript

But the most important record hitherto discovered of
Pali Buddhism in Lower Burma is a book of twenty leaves
of gold, exactly of the nature of old palm-leaf manuscripts
of India, each inscribed on one side, placed within two
covers of the same metal. This unique record also was
discovered at Hmawza, in 1926 last ; but unfortunately it
has not yet been edited and translated, and the text is not,
therefore yet available to scholars. A very short notice of
the find and the contents of the record were, however,
published in the Archaeological Survey Report of India for
1926-27"? which | may, to some extent, supplement here
by my personal knowledge of the record.

The record begins inthe first page with an extract in
Pali giving the important and very well-known Buddhist
formula of the chain of causation or paticca samuppada
sutta. This is followed by long extracts, not connected
together by any inherent meaning and argument, from all
the Three Pitakas—-the Sutta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma;
and is concluded on the last page with the no less well-
known enumeration of the qualities of the Master, beginn-
ing with ‘itipi so bhagavd araham sammdsambuddha.........’
etc. The concluding portion iie. the one recording the
praise of the Triratna presents nothing original or interest-
ing as it is to be found everywhere in the canonical literature

72 An, RASL, 1920-27, p. 200. :

48 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

of the Buddhists, more so because we have had already a
reproduction of the formula in one of the Maunggan gold
plates discussed above, and referred to, for example, in
the Anguttara Nikadya (vol. H, 52, p. 36). The most im-
portant portion of the manuscript, however, is the Paticca
sammuppada siitta round which all interest must centre ;
but owing to the present state of our very meagre and im-
perfect knowledge of the record, it is difficult to hazard a
discussion for which we must wait till the official publica-
cation of the record. So far as | am now ina position
to ascertain, the text of the siitta of the MSS. is possible
to be traced in the very first section of the Mahdvagga of
the Vinaya Pitaka (1. p. 1 f) as well as in the Pali Samyutta
(il, p. 1 £) of the Sidtta Pitaka. In the latter, the text of
the Paticcasamuppddam includes not only the desané
which consists of the Paticcasamuppdada sutia itself and
its nirodha, but also its vibhanga; in the Mahdvagga how-
evet, itis only the desand@ and its nirodha that are set forth.
The Hmawza text, so far as | have been able to make out,
consists of the Siitta itself as well asits nirodha, but no
vibhanga; and the text is just as we find itin the Pali
canon.'*

93 The Pratitys Samutpada Sitra in its Prakrit and Sanskrit
versions is mentioned in very ancient texts. The earliest in Prakrit
can be found in the Kharosthi Inscription on a Kurram Casket edited
by Sten Konow (C.LL, Vol. I. Pe. I no. IXXX); and the latest in
Sanskrit can be found in a Brahmi Inscription on two Nalanda bricks
edited by Dr. N. P. Chakravarty Ep. Ind, Vol. 23....... .) For a
very valuable and interesting note on the Sétra, see Ey. Ind.
VOL ain, eta “A Note on the Pratitya Samuzpada Sitra” by
Dr. P. C. Bagchi. The result of Dr. Bagchi’s analysis as to the
chronology of the texts as quoted in inscriptions and Chinese texts
is set forth as follows: Kurram Insc. text (consisting of Pratilya alone)
—c. 100 A.D.; Sairalamkara text (consisting of Pratitya and Nirodba)

Another gold-leaf inscribed with characters exactly
similar to the one just considered and similarly dateable in
the fifth or sixth centuries A.D. was recovered in 1928-29
from the Kyundawza village near Hmawza. The plate
broken in the process of cleaning in seven fragments
(total length about 834 inches) bears an inscription in
two lines. Itisin Pali and contains the first part of the
well-known Buddhist formula in praise of the Buddha
already discussed above in connection with the second
Maunggan gold-plate (line 2 and last portion of line 1).
Though in the latter portion of the second line the
letters are not so distinct, the inscription which runs as
follows can easily be read without any difficulty :

Istline: Iti pi so bhagava araham sammdAsambuddho
vijjacaranasampanno sugato lokavidii anut-
taro purisa (dhamméasarathi sattha)

2nd line: devamanussanam buddho bhagava ti”*

Vibbanga—4r4 A.D.; Nalanda Insc. text consisting of Pratitya and
Vibhanga) c. 520 A.D.; and now the Hmawza Inscription text (consist-
ing of the Paticca and Nirodhba, in Pali)—c. 500 A.D.

74 “The formula which is in praise of the Buddha, is a
stereotyped one occurring in the Vindya and Sutta Pitakas. The Pyus
appear to have had a predilection for copying short extracts from these
two Pitakas especially from the Abbidhamma, on gold and silver
plates, which were enshrined within pagodas, as well as on terracotta
plaques and stones.”—Duroiselle, da. RAS, 1928-29, pp. 108-9.

In the same Report (p. 107), Duroiselle informs us of the dis-
covery of some terracotta tablets from a mound at Pyogingyi-Kon
bearing effigies of the Buddha on the obverse. The reverse of some
of these contains short extracts from the Abbidhamma, One tablet,
of which only the lower half remains, contains on the obverse a short
insctiption. All these epigraphs are in the self-same Kannada-Telugu
script of the 6th-7th century A.D. The short’ inscription just men-
tioned, is an extract from the Abbidhamma and quite legible:,
(adbi) patipaccayo anantara paccayo

50 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

What these PGli Inscriptions prove?

Whatever be the textual consideration of the epigraphs
discussed above, they would hardly affect the general
deductions that we are even now in a position to make
with regard to the position of Theravada Buddhism in
Old Prome. And these deductions are easily made. [
have already hinted at the purpose these records probably
served, and need not repeat it here. All these records
were inscribed in a familiar script, long known to our
epigraphists as the Kadamba script, of the fifth and sixth
centuries of the Christian era. This script was used in the
records of the Kadambas and early Calukyas, and was
prevalent in the ancient Kuntala (Kanarese district) and
Andhra (comprising the valleys of the Krsna and the
Godavari) regions. The affinity of the Hmawza script
with the Kadamba script is obvious, but it seems that an
evident resemblance may also be found with that used
in the records of the Iksvaku kings found at NagArjuni-
konda’’ and Jaggayyepeta,”® both inthe Krsna valley, and
paleographically dated in the third century. The fact is
that the Hmawza script belongs to the south-Indian variety
of the Brahmi script current in the Andhra-Kuntala region,
and is palzographically dateable in about the fourth and
fifth centuries of the Christian era. The language of the
above records, we have already seen, is Pali; and they
relate themselves to the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism.

The extract is probably from the Pattbana or the 7th Book of the
Abbidhamma. Another tablet contains an extract which appears to be
from the Dhammasangani, the first book of the Abbidhamma, {t
may be read as follows:
Kusala (dhamma aku).

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 51

We can, therefore, safely conclude in the light of
what we have discussed above, that (i) Buddhism of
the Theravada variety was introduced in Old Prome, or, it
is more correct to say, was already an established religion,
at least as early as the fifth century A.D.; (ii) Pdlias the
language of Theravada was known and understood in at
least the capital city, by a certain section at least, of the
people (iii) Pali canonical texts were studied in their
doctrinal and most abstruse aspects (ic) and finally, the
original home from where this Buddhism was introduced
in the old city of Prome was evidently the Andhra-Kuntala
region of South India, from such centres as Amaravati,
Nagarjunikonda, Kaficipuram and Kaveripattanam where
Theravada Buddhism during these centuries had established
famous and flourishing strongholds. It is thus definitely
proved that Theravada Buddhism which in Burma to-day
is of the Ceylonese form was originally introduced not from
Ceylon but from South India, where inthe time of the
celebrated Chinese pilgrim I-ching (671-95) ‘all followed
the Sthavira nikdya though there existed a few adherents
of other nikdyas also’.”” In fact, it was not till the middle
of the twelfth century that Ceylon came to play any im-
portant role in the history of Buddhism in Burma. It was
in 1167 that Panthagu, the then Primate of the Burmese
kingdom, chose Ceylon as his refuge, and in 11&0 Uttarajiva,
the Primate who had succeeded Panthagu returned from
a pilgrimage to Ceylon as the ‘‘First Pilgrim of Ceylon’’.
In 1190 Capata, Uttarajiva’s disciple, earned the title of the
“Second Pilgrim of Ceylon’’, and on his return tried to
convert the whole realm to the Ceylonese form. These
missions and intercourses coupled with Capata’s attempts
to Ceylonise Burmese Buddhism led to the gradual pre-
dominance of Ceylonese Buddhism in Burma and the wip-
ing out of even the memory of the original source. But

to this chapter of the history of the religion in Burma we
shall have occasion to turn later on.

But it is somewhat curious to find that in the whole
range of Pali commentaries and chronicles composed in
Ceylon during the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries, there
is nowhere any mention of the old kingdom or capital of
Prome which, as testified to by the Pali inscriptions and
Buddhist sculptures and monuments, was an important
centre where Theravada Buddhism flourished. There in
the Ceylonese chronicles and in the huge mass of commen-
tarial Hterature incidental references to places made well-
known by their association with Buddhism are but numer-
ous; we might, therefore, reasonably expect to find a
reference to this old kingdom in the Mahdvamsa or at least
in the Cullavamsa, but we are disappointed. May be, the
place has been mentioned in some name which has not yet
been identified; or as the religion of Prome, as we have
suggested was not introduced from Ceylon and had conse-
quently nothing to do with their country the chroniclers and
commentators did not feel inclined to give ita place in
their works. It may also be accounted for by the secular
hostility during all these centuries between the natives
of Ceylon and the Indians of the South, north of the Straits,
which naturally disposed the Ceylonese authors to ignore
the work of their enemies.

(To be continued.)

MISCELLANY

Date of the Earlicst Sanskrit Inscription
of Campa.

Dr. Dines CHANDRA SIRCAR

The famous Vo-chafth Rock inscription was edited by
Bergaigne’ and commented upon by Finot.? It has been
re-edited by Dr. R. C. Majumdar in his Champa.® It has
been pointed out that several lines at the beginning of the
record are lost; that the inscription, composed in Sanskrit,
may be referred, on palaeographic grounds, to the second
or third century A.D.; and that there are two verses in
Vasantatilakd metre in the record the rest of which is in
Prose’:

It seems to me that palaeography has misled scholars
in determining the date of the Vo-chafh inscription. The
language, style and the metre used in the record prove, in
my opinion, that the inscription is later—at least not earlier
than the fourth century A.D.

It is known to all students of Indian epigraphy that al-
most all Indian records (both of kings and private persons),
earlier than the first century A.D., are written in Prakrit.
Sanskrit was not in general use even in the second century
A.D. This century, however, offers us a number of ins-
criptions written in Prakrit mixed with Sanskrit, and also
a few records like the Junagadh Sanskrit record of Rudra-
diman (c. 130—50 A.D.) which “points to the victory of

Sanskrit over the inscriptional Prakrit in some quarters
of western and north-western India. Generally speaking,
Sanskrit began to gradually oust Prakrit from the field of
epigraphy in that part of India about the second century
A.D. ; but the victory was not complete before the fourth
century. Prakrit lost the field in South Indian epigraphy
only about the middle of the fourth century A.D. These
points have béen fully discussed in my paper, I[nscriptional
Evidences relating to the Development of Classical Sanskrit.°
Now; which part of India was responsible for in-
troducing the fashion of composing records in an Indian
language in Far Eastern countries like Campi? Even if
we believe that the colonists belonged to the western and
north-western parts of India, we must admit that the Vo-
chafih inscription is considerably later than the middle of
the second century A.D., because its diction cannot be
compared with any Indian inscription in Sanskrit earlier
than the Junagadh inscription (150 A.D.) of Rudradaman.
If the colonists belonged to Eastern India, the date of our
record should be later, as there is no proof that Sanskrit
became popular in that part of the country before the rise
of the Guptas (320A.D.). If, however, it is believed that
the colonists went from near the mouths of the Krsna
and the Godavari, the Vo-chafth record can hardly be
earlier than the closing years of the fourth century A.D.,
because Prakrit was the language of inscriptions in that
part of India as late as the middle of the fourth century’.

varman as Dharma-mabdarija, This is a typical South Indian style
(Sircar, op. cit, p. 171 m) Possibly the Cho Difh record too
should be placed several decades later...

Again, when were classical metres, like Vasantatilakd,
extensively used in Indian epigraphs? Inscriptions prove
that such metres were certainly not popular er in general
use in India before the rise of the Guptas.” The Vo-chafih
inscription which contains at least two verses in Vasanta-
tilak@ metre, can therefore be hardly assigned to a period
earlier than first half of the fourth century A.D. It may
be later ; but certainly not much earlier.

Social and Physical Anthropology of the Nayadis of
Malabar: By A. Aiyappan, M.A. (Bulletin of the Madras
Government Museum. New Series. General Section,
Vol. IL, No. 4.). Madras, 1937. pp ii+I to 141. Price,
Rs. 3-2-0.

Mr. Aiyappan is to be congratulated on the publica-
tion of this nice monograph on an interesting untouchable
caste of the extreme south of India. The authorities of
the Madras Government Museum have also maintained
their tradition of unstinted support and steady encourage-
ment of anthropological research ushered in by Thurston.
So long Indian ethnography has been devoted to the study
of its tribal population as a result of which we have a
number of excellent monographs on the tribes of the
Nilgiri Hills, Assam and the Chota Nagpur Plateau.
The Universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Lucknow have
recently undertaken the study of a number of other tribes.
But unfortunately the detailed study of individual castes
have so long been systematically neglected by both scho-
lars and institutions. Three years ago Mr. N. A. Thoothi
published his voluminous account of the Vaishnavas of
Gujrat in which he dealt with the different sects of this
religious order which is composed of Hindu castes. Mr.
Aiyappan’s account of the Nayadis is a true caste-mono-
graph written on the lines of tribal monographs and so can
be styled as first of its order. In selecting a group on the
border lines of caste organization Mr. Aiyappan has put
the anthropological theorist under a deep debt of gratitude
by presenting him with a vivid picture of the life and
manners of *'the meanest of the mean among the Hindus, - - -
who pollute by their approach even the Pariah.”

_ The book consists of three parts. The first part, which
deals with culture, gives a fairly detailed account of the
habitat, ethnic environment, material culture, social organi-

NOTICES OF BOOKS 57

zation, ceremonial life, and religion and magic of the
caste. This part is brought to an end with a very useful
account of the measures adopted by different bodies to
improve the condition of the Nayadis and their response
to such outside stimuli. The second part delineates the
physical characters of the people, while the third one con-
tains the records of actual measurements, a glossary of
vernacular words used in the book and the index. The
book is brought to an end with twelve plates including a
map of the area inhabited by the Nayadis.

The Nayadis are a short, dolichocephalic, platyrrhine
people with an extremely hypsicephalic head. Their head
hair is flat (low), wavy and deep black in colour. Com-
pared with their neighbours they are ‘‘midway between
the hill tribes and the castes of the plains.”” According to
our author “though the figures do not reveal it sufficiently,
there is present among the Nayadis a very small percentage
of individuals relatively shorter in stature and darker in
complexion and with broader face than the rest, closely
resembling the Veddoid primitive.”’ |

The Nayadis now occupy the three southern taluks of
the Malabar District and the northernmost part of the Cochin
State adjacent to Ponnani taluk. According to our author
they live on the outskirts of the deciduous forests, on the
lower slopes of the-Ghats and their spurs and from the dis-
tribution of the caste it appears that the trend of migration
had been from the east towards the west. This was
brought about by a movement of the peoples from the plains
of the west towards the forests of the east owing to econo-
mic pressure. Thus, the Nayadis came to live among the
Hindu castes. Their number according to the Census
returns of 1931 is 709 only, but according to our author the
144 Nayadis of Travancore State are really Ulladans. So
the actual number comes to 565 only. |

According to Dr. Gundert the word -Nayadi has two
meanings: (1) a hunter, and (2) ‘the lowest caste of jungle
dwellers ordered to retire seventy-four steps from the high
castes.’ The latter meaning fixes the social position of the

58 NOTICES OF BOOKS

caste at the lowest level in the area under consideration.
Above them are the Cherumans, lravans, and Nayars who
pollute the Namputiri Brahmin from a distance of 64 it.,
32 ft., and 7ft., respectively. ‘‘It is said that, in order to
purify oneself afer being polluted by a Nayadi, one should
bathe in seven streams and seven tanks, and then let out
a few drops of blood from a little finger.’’ This clearly
indicates the attitude of orthodox Hinduism towards this
wretched group of humanity.

Begging forms the main occupation of the caste and is
the chief source of its livelihood. ‘‘The Nayadis live chiefly
on what they receive as alms on various occasions from the
rest of the Hindu community. It is the privilege and right
of the Nayadis to beg and it is the duty of the others to
give.’’ Charity has been woven into the fabric of Hindu
faith and according to our author, in the South, charity to
particular castes such as Nayadis, Pulluvans and others,
is more meritorious than to ordinary beggars (pichchakkars).

“It is a sin not to give privileged beggars......, just as it
is a sin not to give to Brahmins.’’ The ordinary beggars
(pichchakkars) have no right to demand charity but have
to depend on and rouse the sympathy of the rich. Thus
the Nayadis occupy a privileged position even in their
miserable existence. There are special days and occasions
on which they receive charity. Thus, on birth-days and at
the conclusion of death-rituals high caste people make gifts
to them. When a person falls seriously ill gifts are
made to the Nayadi to ward off death. These are his
main sources of livelihood at present.

It has been stated that the word Nayadi means ‘hunter.’
In the Keralotpatti hunting is mentioned as the profession
of the Nayadis while in the Nayattuvidhi, an ancient
treatise on hunting, they are spoken of as ‘“‘friends who
stand at hand’” at the time of hunting. In a Portuguese
~Manuscript of about: 1676 A.D. they are referred to as a
caste of hunters ' who have no ther occupation and who

“are obliged to. accompany. the Naire, Gentio and Christian
i hunters.” Welsh in. bis Military Reminiscences (1730)
NOTICES OF BOOKS 59

refers to exchange of jungle products for necessities of life
between the Nayadis and the peoples of the plains. He
also writes about their manufacture of rude baskets and
ropes for sale and their skinfulness in scouring the jungles.
Visscher (1743) also speaks of them as hunters who live on
the flesh of wild beasts supplemented by herbs and roots
so much so that there were persons among them who had
never tasted rice. Thus, up to the middle of the 18th
century they appear to have been hunters and collectors of
roots and fruits and we have no mention of | their
begging habits. But at the beginning of the [9th
century Buchanan (1803) perhaps records for the first time
that the Nayadis chiefly subsist on begging besides working
as beaters in hunting and as watchers of crops. Lt.
Connor in 1833 wrote that the Nayadis depend on charity
while in Pharoah’s Gazetteer (1855) they are characterised
as beggars by birth and trade. Thus from the beginning
: of the 19th century they are characterised as an worthless
set of vagabonds living on charity. This transformation of
: the Nayadis is ascribed by Mr. Aiyappan to “‘the rigidity
of the forest laws, and the Arms Act and the difficulty of
making a living by chase’’ which forced them to give up

their ancestral occupation and become beggars. This
was further accelerated by increase of population in the
plains leading to cultivation of forest land which deprived

the Nayadis of their natural environment and the basis of
their economic life. This may, however, account for their
f giving up the old mode of subsistence but it does not at
: the same time supply sufficient grounds for their adoption

of beggary as a profession: Mr. Aiyappan has not also
tried to give any reason for the absence of any attempt. on
the part of the Nayadis to move further into the interior of
the forest-clad hills where they could have easily practised
their previous mode of living. In other parts of India
whenever the habitat of a forest tribe: is attacked by the
dwellers of the plains it either moves further into the inte-
rior or adopts the more improved economic methods of the
trespassers and therewith fight against them. Moreover,

the position of the Nayadis is of a peculiar nature. They
are neither an order of religious mendicants nor a group
of common beggars who have taken to this means of live-
lihood owing to indigent circumstances as the pichchakkhars.
They form a caste of professional beggars, secure in their
privileged position owing to association with the religious
beliefs and customs of the higher caste Hindus. How they
attained this privileged position has not been pointed out.
In other parts of India such privileges are enjoyed by the
Brahmins mainly and other orders of religious mendicants
together with outcaste Brahmins. But in the South, it
appears, a number of low castes enjoy this privilege along
with the Brahmins and other religious orders. The tradi-
tional genetic relation of the Nayadis with the Brahmins as
well as their midway position between the higher castes
and the lower castes and tribes, both physically and cultural-
ly, may give us a clue to their real origin. The case of the
Agradaniya Brahmins of Bengal is suggestive in this
connection.

The Nayadis live in small settlements.of three or four
huts away from the domiciles of other castes. They build
thatched huts with mud walls on raised plinths of beaten
earth. Every settlement has a mannu which is a sacred spot
under a big tree where a number of blocks of stone link
the living with the dead and the supernatural.

The social organization of the Nayadis is very simple.
“Each kinship and family group have their area (desam) for
begging clearly delimited by will-marked boundaries. The
owner of a begging division mortgages or sells his right in
the area in times of need.’’ Besides these economic
groupings, they are also divided into number of patrilineal
illams (house) or kuttam (horde) which correspond to the
farvad of the other castes. The illam is an exogamous
body and its members may be found either in one settle-
ment or in a number of villages separated by considerable
distance. There is. some difference between the social
status. of the different illams. Each illam has a name of

its own, some of which are derived from place-names.

The Nayadis “‘usually marry cross-cousins and only in
their absence classificatory cross-cousins......... Remarriages
are rare, widows being usually taken over by the brothers
of the deceased husbands.” The last part of the preceding
sentence is not however clear. Is it a mere case of mainte-
nance without sexual intimacy or both without any ceremo-
nial function? On page 55 the author states that the
widews ussually remarry and on page 58 he refers to the
custom of levitate in Walluvanad taluk and its absence in
Palghat taluk. Thus, there is some contradiction between
the evidence of the genealogical tables and abstract state-
ment of marriage customs, which have not been accounted
for.

The instance of transference of wife to a parallel cousin
yecorded on page 40 may be the effect of general rules of
divorce and remarriage and do not show a new custom.
The author has not unfortunately recorded which of the
cousins is elder, as it would have given us an opportunity
to test the arguments in favour of senior levirate put for-
ward on page 58.

Marriage is a common incident in the life of a Nayadi.
Mr. Aiyappan refers to obligatory cross-cousin matriage
but does not give particulars about its working and the
degree of compulsion, nor does he mention whether both
the types of cross-cousin marriage occur or only one type.
He, however, records an actual case of marriage with the
mother’s brother’s daughter but as to the other type there
is no reference. Betrothal often takes palce when the
patties are very young and the author speaks of pre-marital
and even pre-puberty sexual union between prospective
brides and bridegrooms. The bride-wealth is nominal
when the marriage occurs between the children of brother
and sister and in most cases it ranges between Rs. 2/-
and Rs. 4/- only. The bridegroom's sister plays an im-
portant part in the marriage rites and no. Nayadi marriage
is possible without her.

The mortuary practices of the Nayadis differ i in the differ-
ent taluks owing to difference i in the. degree’ of absorption of

62 NOTICES OF BOOKS

Hindu culture. Thus in the Ponnani taluk burial js prac-
tised while in Walluvanad cremation is the rule. They
strongly believe in the survival of the dead. The spirit of
the deceased is supposed to move about till it is ‘housed’
in the mannu either on the [5th day after death or at the
conclusion of the first year. A piece of stone or sometimes
a rough representation in wood is set up in the mannu at
this time with offerings of food.

The religion of the Nayadis consists of worship of the
gods and the ancestors. Their ritual attitude to both the
categories is practically the same. Both are represented
in the mannu with pieces of stone—bigger pieces for the
gods and the smaller ones for the ancestors. ‘‘The ances-
tors though sacred, are intermediate between the gods and
living men. Gods are umiversally worshipped and are
common to all, while the ‘elders’ who were members of a
particular kinship group only, are not paid special regard
by outsiders, except that in a very few instances the spirit
of a particularly brilliant hunter or magician is worshipped
by a larger group than this now kin.’’ Maladaivam (the
god of the hills), Kali (the famous Hindu goddess) and
Chattan are some of the more important deities of
the Nayadis, who are worshipped in the mannu.
They also believe in a Supreme God who is sometimes
identified with the sun but he is not worshipped on any
occasion though he is invoked at times of difficulty and
oaths are taken in his name. There are shamans who
officiate in the sacred rites but it is not clearly mentioned
who act as shamans. The Nayadis ‘“‘do not share the
Hindu concepts of rebirth, hell; heaven and the Hindu
theory of Karma.’’ The higher castes attribute to them
the knowledge of powerful black magic and this belief is
of some economic value to the Nayadis who are, as a
result, sometimes employed to watch gardens against
thieves or to repel attacks of pests.

In conculsion, we welcome this well-informed and
well-written monograph on an untouchable caste about
which the anthropologists. have very little idea, and con-

New Gatalogus Catalogerum: A complete and up-to-date
Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit and Allied Works and
Authors. Published under the Authority of the University
of Madras. Provisional fasciculus. Madras 1937.

It is a happy sign of the times that Indian scholars have
of late been engaged in research based on real and inten-
sive study of Mss some of which have seen the light of day
but many are, and will remain, embedded in the archives of
Mss. collections. Aufrecht’s Catalogus Catalogorum, the
encyclopaedic Ms. bibliography and index which has helped
and inspired Oriental research for more than three decades
is badly in need of being supplemented with accounts of
numerous Mss. that have since come to light. The Madras
University is to be heartily congratulated on its undertaking
this much-needed task. The provisional fasciculus which
was published some months ago bears ample evidence of
the earnest endeavours of the band of scholars working
under he guidance of MM. Prof. S. Kuppuswami Sastri
who has achieved the distinction of organising a school
(sampraddya) of competent and sincere researchers in the
different departments of Indology. The Oriental scholar
shall have to be thankful to the Editorial Board as much
for the new light thrown on comparatively well-known works
and authors (e.g. the Akérddinighantu, Akdlajalada and
Aghoragivacarya} and on presentation of new items of
textual criticism (e.g. under Agastyasamihita and the
Agnipurdna) as for the new entries which, so far as the present
part is concerned, are at least as numerous as the old ones.
While appreciating the magnitude of this “‘stupendous cul-
tural task'’ that the Board has undertaken and thanking it
for its creditable achievement, one would like to draw its

attention to a few important points. Unnecessary duplica-

tion (e.g. on Aksobhyatirtha, Akandarthadipika, . Agaravi-

64 NOTICES OF BOOKS

noda, AkSapada) which in several cases are verbatim reprints
from Aufrecht’s work, could easily have been dispensed with.
The mispagination (pp. 9-16) is regrettable printing. Some
of the misprints, not all of which are noted in the appended
errata (e.g. on p. I] under Agastya, MM. Gananath Sen
has been shown as MM. Ganganath Sen) are somewhat
confusing. The tendency to overburden a work which is
primarily meant for the antiquarian with entries of very
late or modern works of questionable value (e.g. the
Arsubodhini and the Sdhityaprakdsa of Aksaya Kumar
Vidyavinoda) and with entries of many unimportant
works of a particular province (e.g. the Agastydstaka,
Agastyesvardstaka, Aksaramdlikdstava, Aksaramalikaryd)
should be checked. One hopes that the item No. 5 in the
Preface, viz.—incorporation of works and authors known
through citations alone with appropriate references as far
as possible—-should receive its proper share of attention. It
is also to be desired that the names of works obviously
misspelt in Mss. be corrected by queries within brackets
(e.g, Afgirdkalpa=Angirah-kalpa?, Angirapri= Angirah-
Apri 2). It is a pity that in some cases the reports of compilers
of Mss have not been checked. Such is the case with Akala-
bhaskara where the entry is based on what is reported in
R. L. Mitra’s Notices, Vol. VII, p. 36, the work really treat-
ing of impure periods of the year in general, and not merely
of the intercalary months. This has presumably been due
to lack of co-ordination. Attention may also be drawn to
the need of avoiding a partisan spirit such as has been
done on p. 24 under the Agnismrti and on p. 13 under the

_ Agastyasamhitad. What is wanted is an unambiguous state-
ment of views when they tend to be unanimous, and, when

necessary, a clear reference to the views of different scholars,
leaving it to. further research to solve the problem. A
suggestion may be offered in this connection. The Editorial

_ Board will be well-advised in seeking the assistance of

scholars of different provinces who could check Mss written

in local scripts, and of those who are authorities on their
respective subjects, so that no subject can go by default.

NOTICES OF BOOKS 65

These are minor defects in a work which has been
begun at the right moment and at the right place and which,
it is hoped, will be carried through in the proper spirit,
and, when completed, will redound to the credit of the
Madras University and will afford the scholarly world all
help and guidance that can be expected of it.

La litterature Ghinoise by Basile Alexéiev. Published in the
Annales du Musée Guimet, Paul Geuthner, 12 Rue
Vavin.

The book contains six lectures of which three twere
delivered in the Collége de France and the rest in the
Musée Guimet. The author is a recognised sinological
authority and needs no fresh introduction. The first three
lectures deal with the Chinese literature with special refer-
ence to its ideology, its foreign translations and readers and
the last three with Chinese poetry with special reference
to its ideology, its poetical values and reformist tendencies.
The author tells us that to understand properly the Chinese
literature it is necessary to have an exact idea of the ancient
religions of China, Confucianism and Taoism. These two
religions influenced the ancient literature so well that the
Chinese literature acquired two primary tendencies viz. to
propagate the ‘truth’ and to arouse a sense of beatitude
completely divorced from the reality. Ignorance of these
tendencies has falsified the foreign translations of the an-
cient Chinese works. The Christian and Buddhist transla-
tions of foreign texts into Chinese are also equally bad.
Both these translations are unintelligible to the Chinese and
have never been liked by them. The Buddhist missionaries
in China however before placing the translated texts in the
hands of the Chinese, had given them a well-organised
cult which perfectly responded to the elementary religious
sentiments. This helped the Chinese to understand the
Buddhist texts better than the translations of the

66 NOTICES OF BOOKS

Bible to understand which they had no preparation. The
other lectures of M. Alexéiev are illuminating and contain
not only a novel treatment of the Chinese literature but also
a critical estimate of the new tendencies in the contemporary
Chinese literature.

sode extrait du Mahabharata. Traduit et adapté du tamoul,

Librarie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner. Paris 1937.

This book is meant for the general public. The author
gives here in outline the legend of Krsna—specially the

amorous part of it—-on the basis of its Tamil version. No

attempt has been made to utilise the original sources or to
determine the historical position of the Tamil version.
Krsna’s exploits, such as the Vastraharana of the Gopis, have
been described with embarrassing details supplied partly
by the author’s own exuberant imagination. Yet Mr.
-Juvanon in his preface does not hesitate to connect this
Krsna with the ‘“‘belles legons et haute moralité.”’ It is
difficult to find what purpose will be served by this book.

Archaeological Remains and Excavations at Bairat.
By Daya Ram Sahni. Published by the Department of
Archaeology and Historical Research, Jaipur State, 1937.

Discoveries of the remnants of two Aégokan pillars and
a temple of an entirely new type as well as a monastery,
both erected by the great Buddhist emperor, are some of
the startling results obtained by the late Director-General of
the Archaeological Survey of India and first Director
of Archaeological and Historical Research in Jaipur State
(Rajputana) during the excavations at Bairat in 1936.

Traditionally associated with the Pandava heroes of
the. Mahabharata, who passed their thirteenth year of con-
NOTICES OF BOOKS 67

cealment at Virdtapura, the capital of Virata kings of the
Matsya country, the ancient site of Bairat was visited and
examined by Cunningham in 1864-65 and by his assistant
Mr. Carleylle in 1871-72 and lastly by Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar
in 1909-10. The importance of the site and its former
glory is fully attested by a series of surviving architectural
monuments of the Hindu and Muslim periods.

Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni points out that the famous
so-called Bhabru Rock-Edict of Agcka was found not at
Bhabru but at Bairat itself. So the discovery of other
Agokan relics at the latter place is not surprising. The
exposed remains are distributed on two distinct platforms
on a hill known as Bijak-ki-pahari or the “inscription hill”’
as it contained the Edict found by Captain Burt in 1840.
The excavations have brought to light the ruins of a brick
monastic establishment on the upper platform. One of the
cells yielded a small pottery jar full of 36 silver coins, eight
of which wrapped in a piece of cloth, were punch-marked
and the other 28 were cof Greek and Indo-Greek kings.
According to Sahni the discovery of the coins leads to three
important conclusions, viz., that punch-marked coins con-
tinued to be circulated down to the Ist century A.D. or
even to a later period, that Bairat and the adjoining areas
formed part of the Greek and Indo-Greek dominions and
that the said monastery continued to be in occupation until
about 50 A.D. Other portable antiquites from this area in-
clude terracotta Yaksi figures akin to the Mathura speci-
mens and a pilaster.

But diggings in the lower platform revealed the most
important ruin in the form of a circular brick temple with
remains of octagonal columns partly brick and partly weoden
surrounded by a rectangular enclosure wall. “‘This is the
oldest structural temple and one of those which furnished
models for the numerous rock-cut cave temples of Western
and Eastern India. The nearest approach, both in plan
and design to this newly discovered temple is the caiiya
cave of about the Ist century B.C. in the Tulja Lena group
at Junnar.” That this temple was. undoubtedly the work

68 NOTICES OF BOOKS

of Agoka is proved by the find of fragmentary remains of
two pillars in Chunar sandstone with the characteristic
Maurya polish and the Brahmi inscriptions of the Agokan
period on walls of the temple.

This clearly-printed and well-illustrated monograph is
otherwise interesting reading but for a grave historical error
which has crept into the text. The destruction of the pillars,
opines Sahni, ‘‘could not have taken place at such a late date
as the end of the 12th century A.D., when Shihab-ud-Din
Ghori destroyed the Buddhist remains at Sarnath or the 14th
century A.D, when Bakhtiyar Khalji massacred the shaven-
headed Buddhist monks in Behar and Nalanda monasteries,””
History records that Mahammad-i-Bakhtiyar concuered Bihar

and animated style with no pretence to scholarly accuracy
or completeness, but inspired by a feeling of intense rever-
ence for our ancestral culture, these sketches should make
an earnest appeal to the large section of our countrymen
who have neither the time nor the opportunity to go to the
NOTICES OF BOOKS 69

more authoritative publications on the subject. It is further
to be hoped that the author’s repeated lament about the
neglect of Greater India studies by Indian scholars and even
his shrewd suggestions on many points raised by him in the
course of his descriptions will provoke a greater interest in
scholarly circles in this country than has been the case
heretofore.

In the Pilgrimage to Greater India the author passes in
review the well-known centres of Hindu culture in Cam-
bodia, Java and Bali. He gives short descriptions of Angkor
Thom with the Bayon, Angkor Vat and other buildings of
this group. Coming to Java, he describes some selected
images from the Batavian Museum, his experience of
shadow-plays with the gamelan orchestra at Jogjakarta, and
his impressions of Prambanan and Borobudur. Then
follows his sketch of Bali island containing interesting
notices of funeral ceremonies, feasts and cults as well as
social institutions of the people.

The Brhattara Bharater Pajapadrvan (The Cults and Fes-
tivities of Greater India) contains three sections, viz., gods,
and goddesses, popular amusements, and form of worship,
along with four Appendices. Among the points noticed by
the author are the paucity of linga form of Siva, the com-
plete absence of Radha-Krsna images, the ‘aboriginal cult-
influences, the frequency of Arjuna images and so forth.
Coming to the popular amusements the author gives attrac-
tive sketches of dance and music, of plays (specially
shadow-play) etc. that are in vogue in Java and Bali.
Dealing with the forms of worship, he makes some weighty
but unfortunately short remarks regarding the points of
similarity and contrast between Hindu and Balinese ritual.
These observations derived from the author's intimate
knowledge of Hindu religious ritual have to be carefully
considered by specialists. The same. remark applies to
Appendices II and III containing short notices of the mantras
and the mudrds that are used by the Bdunese priests down
to the present times.

70 NOTICES OF BOOKS

In Kamboja (in Bengali) the author brings together a
number of references to a country and people called by this
name in the Mahabharata, in the Ramayana, the Puranas
and so forth. From these he draws a number of inferences
about the early history of Cambodia and its relations with
India. The value of these remarks is minimised by the
author's neglect to locate the Kambojas of Hindu Litera-
ture along with the Sakas and Yavanas on the north-west
frontier.

In Campa, the author after dealing briefly with the race,
language and religion of the Chams, gives a short history of
their country from the early period of Hindu colonisation to
the Annamite conquest. This is followed by a series of
discourses in the course of which the author while paying a
well-deserved tribute to the work of the French School of
the Far East, pleads for a systematic interpretation of the
archaeological and other data from the point of view of the
Hindu éastras. Then follows a short account of Cham
images compared with their Indian counterparts.

Suvarnadvipa, which the author somewhat loosely
equates with Sumatra, is the title of another work in which
we are told at some length about the original inhabitants of
the island, the Achins, the Bataks, the Minangkabaus and
others. Then follow some disjointed notes on the rise and
fall of the Srivijaya kingdom, which the author identifies
with the Sailendra empire. This identification, it will be
remembered, has recently been questioned on good grounds.

In Malay, the author after tracing the geography and the
ethnology of the people, traces their history from the begin-
ing of Indian colonisation to the advent of Islam. Then
follows a short section on Malacca containing the history of
the kingdom down to the time of Portuguese conquest in
1510. This is followed by short sketches of the history of
Singapore (with a notice of the Raffles Museum) and of
Johore in the 18th century. It is to be regretted that a
number of mistakes has crept into this work.

Samadhirajasutra, chaps. VIII], XIX, and XXII.
Edited with Tibetan version, English Translations and Notes
by K. Régamey. The Warsaw Society of Sciences and
Letters. Publications of the Oriental Commission. 1938,
pp. 111.

The publication of a portion of the Samdadhirdja came
as a happy surprise to me as | had been working on a ms. of
this siitra found at Gilgit. It is one of the nine major texts
of the Nepalese Buddhists, but its value so far has not been
very much appreciated on account of its prolixity and endless
repetitions, the sad characteristics of most of the early
Mahayana texts. It is really a matter of gratification for us
to find that two distinguished scholars, like Prof. S. Schayer
and Dr. Régamey though living at Warsaw have essayed the
arduous task of editing the whole text overcoming many
handicaps usually encountered by scholars living so far off
from India.

This siitra was better known to the ancients as Candra-
pradipa-sitra or Sarvadharmasamatdavipaficita-sitra, by which
two titles we generally find references in the early works like
those of Santideva. As the editor Dr. Régamey has utilised
four mss., the Chinese and Tibetan versions of the work and
above all the Tibetan commentaries, there is very little to be
said about the readings of the text. The mss, though
numbering four are generally derived from one archetype
and hence they are not of much value, but the Tibetan
renderings help us in settling the doubtful readings. The
printing of the text in Roman characters does not appeal to
us very much and particularly the gathads in running lines.

The three chapters selected by the editor for giving an
idea of the doctrinal standpoint of the siitra deal with
abhavasvabhdvajfidna, (things are — really non-existent);
acintyabuddhadharmanirdeéa (inconceivable nature of Bud-
dha-dharmas); and tathagatakaya (the real body of the
Buddha). The editor traces in this siitra not the extreme
Sanyavada of Nagarjuna but the Sdnyavada of the Yogacara
School, which posits the pure ciifa as ‘the ultimate essence.
In chap. XIX, there is s nothing oe much aminotiance except

72 NOTICES OF BOOKS

that it attempts to magnify the merits of the ‘Samadhi’, the
principal theme of the work, to an infinite extent. The
editor’s observation on the Kaya conceptions based on chap.
XXII, are valuable and are in agreement with mine expressed
in my ‘Aspects of Mahayana Buddhism’. The English render-
ing is quite good and the Sanskrit-Tibetan—Chinese Index is
indeed very useful. The attention given by the editor to
the metres of the gathds and the variant readings deserve
commendation and reveals how much labour and energy has
been devoted by him to make the edition as thorough as
possible. This, of course, has been partly possible for con-
centrating his energies on a very small portion of the werk;
but for us it will be useful as we shall be able to place it in
the hands of our students as a text-book and an ideal edition
of a Buddhist-Sanskrit work.

EXTRACTS FROM THE REPORT OF THE GREATER
INDIA SOCIETY FROM Isr APRIL 1937
TO 3ist DECEMBER 1938

General

The Greater India Society completed the eleventh year
of its existence in 1938. The record of the Society's work
during the period under review was on the whole one of
steady progress.

Management

A number of changes took place in the constitution of
the Managing Committee during this period. Dr. U. N.
Ghoshal, Hony. Secretary, being absent: from India for
nearly four months (August-October 1938), his place was
temporarily filled by Dr. Nalinaksha Dutt. The Society was
also temporarily deprived of the services of Dr. Kalidas Nag
who visited Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines
during a short period of four or five months. In November
1938 Mr. N. G. Majumdar, Special Officer for Exploration
for the Archaeological Survey of India, who was for many
years a member of the Managing Committee of the Greater
India Society, lost his hfe under most tragic circumstances
while exploring the pre-historic antiquities in Sind. The
Managing Committee through the Hony. Secretary duly sent
a message of condolence to the bereaved family of the late
scholar, .

During the period under review. the Hony. Sabeeais con-
tinued to act as Editor of the Seciety’s Journal over and
above his usual duties, The constitution of the Journal
Committee remained unchanged,

As in preceding years the important business of the
Committee was disposed of as the occasion arose by circu-
lation among the members.:

Office
No change took place in the Office establishment. Mr.
P. K. Sen, Chartered Accountant, again earned the thanks
of the Committee by kindly acting as the Hony. Auditor of
the Society’s accounts for the third time in succession,

Members and Subscribers

74

The number of members on the Society’s roll on 3lst
December 1938 showed a slight increase. The total number
of subscribers to the Society’s Journal reached a higher figure
than in any previous year. While on this subject, the Com-
mittee cannot but convey its most sincere thanks to the
Provincial Governments of India and the Indian Univer-
sities, to the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey
of India and the Superintendents of different Archaeological
Circles, to the Government Epigraphist for India and his
subordinate officers and to the Governments of Baroda,
Mysore, Travancore, Gwalior and Indore for continued
patronage of the Society’s Journal.

Finance

The closing balance of the Society’s accounts on the
31st December 1938 was Rs. 1,148-9-8 as compared with the
opening balance of Rs. 844-0-8 on the Ist April 1937. As
against this favourable state of the Society’s finances must be
set its commitment viz., the publication of Dr. Tucci’s
Travels of Tibetan Pilgrims in the Swat Valley which is
still in the Press. On the receipt side the Committee has
gratefully to acknowledge the grant of Rs. 800/- from the
National Council of Education, Bengal, at the rate of
Rs. 400/- for two successive years, and of Rs. 100/-
from Dr. Narendra Nath Law, one of its most valued
members. The Committee is also indebted to Dr. Bimala
Churn Law for a handsome donation of Rs, 500/-
in support of the Society. During the nineteen months
ended 3ist December 1938, receipts under the head ‘Sale
Proceeds of Publications’ amounted to Rs, 524-3-9 with
which may be compared the figures for the preceding two

pene

REPORT OF THE GREATER INDIA SOCIETY 75
years, viz., Rs. 415-12-6 (1936-37) and Rs. 543-8-9 (1935-36).

During the period under review subscriptions to the Society's
Journal realised Rs. 353-0-0 as compared with Rs, 181-3-0
for the year 1936-37 and Rs. 229-13-0 for 1935-36. On the
Expenditure side publications formed as in former years
the heaviest item, accounting for Rs. 911-5-0 of which as
much as Rs. 779-7-6 was incurred for cost of three issues of
the Journal. These figures which cover a period of nineteen
months obviously furnish no basis for comparison with the
figures for the previous years. The same observations
apply to the other items of expenditure, such as ‘postal
charges’ and ‘allowance to the staff’ which last includes the
typist’s and proof-reader’s charges for the Journal.

Lectures

During the period under notice seven popular lectures
were delivered according to the terms of our agreement with
the National Council of Education, Bengal, under the joint
auspices of the Greater India Society and the National
Council. The Lectures as in former years covered a wide
variety of subjects as will appear from the subjoined list :—
“India in Europe”’ (2 lectures) by Dr. Suniti Kumar Chatter-
jee, © Institutions of Australia’’ (2 lectures) by Dr. Kalidas Nag,
“Cultural Institutions in Philippines’ by Dr. Kalidas Nag,
‘‘Mahayanism in Burma’’ by Dr. Niharranjan Ray, “India and
Oceania’ by Dr. Kalidas Nag. The Committee conveys its
thanks to all these gentlemen for their valued co-operation.

Publications |

Four issues of the Journal appeared during this period,
Vol. IV, Nos. | and 2, and Vol. V, Nos, | and 2. That the
standard of the Journal was kept at its old level will appear
from the fact that among its contributors were numbered
some of the foremost authorities on their respective subjects
and nearly all the first-rate journals on Greater India were
on its exchange-list. Among other points of interests under
this head the Committee has to mention that a considerable
progress was made in the printing. of Prof. G. Tucci’s

“6 REPORT OF THE GREATER INDIA SOCIETY

“Travels of Tibetan Pilgrims in the Swat Valley.” The
Committee also mentions with satisfaction that Mr, H. B.
Sarkar completed during this period his translation of Prof.
Krom’s Hindoe-Javaansche Geschiedenis of which the preli-
minary sheets were sent to the author for revision and
were received back by the Secretary.

The Committee notes with concern that except one of
the Bulletins all the rest are completely out of stock or very
nearly so. The Committee hopes as in former years that
new and revised editions of these useful works for which
there is a steady demand will be undertaken at no distant
date.

Congresses and Conferences

In December 1937 the Ninth Session of the All-India
Oriental Conference held its sessions at Trivandrum under
the distinguished patronage of H. E. the Maharaja of
Travancore. The Greater India Society was represened at
the Conference by a number of delegates, including Mr. O.
C, Gangoly, Dr. S. K. Chatterjee, Mr. J. N. Banerjea and
the Hony. Secretary. The delegates participated in the
proceedings of the Conference under their respective sec-
tions. The Hony. Secretary utilised the opportunity of the
visit of Dr. W. F. Stutterheim, Head of the Archaeological
Department, Java, and one of the distinguished delegates
from abroad present at the Conference for settling an ex-
change of photographs of the Javanese Archaeological
Department for a set of the Society’s publications. These
precious photographs, numbering more than 70, have since
been received by the Society.

In August 1938 the Hony. Secretary Bictded by invita-
tion the Eighth International Congress of Historical Sciences
at Zurich where he read a paper in the section “‘History of
Non-European Lands” of which he was appointed Vice-
President. The Twentieth session of the International
Congress of Orientalists was held at Brussels in the follow-
ing week and was attended by Drs, U. N. Ghoshal and S. K.

Chatterjee _ as “representatives of the Greater India Society
REPORT OF THE GREATER INDIA SOCIETY a

and the Calcutta University. Both of them offered papers
under their respective sections and otherwise participated
in the proceedings of the Congress. In September 1938,
Dr. Kalidas Nag attended the Second sessions of the British
Commonwealth Relations Conference at Sydney in the
capacity of a representative of the Government of India.

Library

During the period under review the Society's collection
of books etc. continued to be enriched with a constant
stream of publications received by exchange or for purpose
of review. These were made over according to the arrange-
ment made in the previous year to the Calcutta University
Library where they were kept as a separate collection.

Conclusion -

In concluding this brief report of the working of the
Society for the period from Ist April 1937 to 31st December
1938, the Committee cannot but express its most sincere
thanks to those patrons and well-wishers of the Society who
have contributed to its success. Apart from the National
Council of Education and from Drs. Narendra Nath Law and
B. C. Law who made handsome donations to the Society's
funds, the Committee is thankful to Mr. Ramananda
Chatterjee and Dr. Narendra Nath Law for free advertise-
ments of the Society’’s publications in their respective
papers. The Committee however feels that more funds are
needed for meeting the Society’s urgent needs such as its
own building with some additional furnitures. Still more is
the Society’s need for young recruits who will worthily carry
on the work that it has started under difficult circumstances.
The Committee appeals to every patriotic man and woman
of India to take up this work and it earnestly trusts that its
appeal will not go in vain.

Contributions from the Mahavamsa to our

knowledge of the Mediaeval Culture
of Ceylon

By Dr. WILHELM GEIGER
(Continued from ].G.1.S. Vol. V, No. 2.)

VI. SETTLEMENT—VILLAGES AND TOWNS

79. The Aryan colonisation of Ceylon had a purely agri-
cultural character. The first settlements were a number of
small villages (gama) founded by the leaders of the Aryan
immigrants in the fifth century B.c, There are two different
traditions concerning this event in the chronicle. Accord-
ing to Mahavamsa 7.39, 43-45 it was Vijaya who founded
Tambanninagara, whilst his companions built the villages
Anuradhagama, Upatissagama, Ujjeni, Uruvela and Vijita-
nagara. But according to 9. 9-11 the villages Ramagama,
Anuradhagama, Uruvela, Vijitagama, Dighayu (gama), and
Rohana were founded by six Sakya princes, the brothers of
Bhaddakaccdna who was the consort of the second king
Panduvasudeva.

The historical kernel of these traditions may be the fact
that the first stream of immigrants who, led by Vijaya, came
from N.-W. India, was soon followed by another stream from

82 WILHELM GEIGER

N.-E. India. But all these settlements had the character of
villages, and it seems that they could be called nagara or
pura, if they were in any way fortified and might serve as
refuge in times of danger. The necessity of a fortification
may sometimes have been felt, if the village was exposed to
assaults of the wild aboriginal inhabitants of the island. But
among the oldest settlements there are only two, the names
of which end in nagara: Tambapanni and Vijitanagara,
and the latter name alternates with Vijitagama. According
to the description in 23.28 it was indeed fortified. It had
three trenches and was guarded by a high wall and furnish-
ed with iron-shod gates. Nevertheless, we are certainly
justified in saying that at the beginning of the medizeval
period of Sinhalese history there existed in Ceylon, with the
only exception of Anuradhapura, hardly any settlement
which had the character of a town. Anuradhapura itself
which was founded by the fourth traditional king Panduka-
bhaya near old Anuradhagima, and which was from that
time onwards the centre of the Aryan colony and the royal
residence, could be called pura, because it was fortified
with wall and trenches.

In the whole of the ancient Mahavamsa, apart from
Tambapanninagara and Vijitanagara, only six names of
settlements are met with, which end in nagara, and among
them two, Kalahanagara and Pajjotanagara, are expressly
designated as villages (10.42; 25.51).

The Aryan immigrants came to Ceylon with the intention
to found a new home where they could earn their livelihood
by agriculture. But they forthwith came across a serious
dificulty. The main corn cultivated in India was rice, but
in Ceylon rice can be produced in sufficient quantities only
where the yearly rainfall is over 75 inches. This is the case
in the hilly country and in the south-western districts. But
according to the tradition it was not these wet parts of the
island that were first colonised by the Aryan immigrants, but
the low-country and up-country north of the mountains.
The Aryans came ashore in all probability somewhere on the

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE MAHAVAMSA 83

north-western coast between Mannar and Puttalam, so that
they had before them the flat land which corresponds to the
modern North-Central Province, and they settled there.
The tradition is plausible, for the hilly country was too
difficult of access, and in the south-western districts cultiva-
tion was checked by frequent and tremendous floods of the
rivers. These parts of Ceylon came only later under the
control of the Aryan colonists after they had establishec
their rule in the more accessible open districts. But just in
these districts where the Aryans first settled, the rainfall is
only between 50 and 75 inches in a year, and they are also
subject to periodical drought so that the wells become ex-
hausted and the necessary supply of drinkable water is
sometimes lacking in the hottest months.

Thus the Aryan colonists were from the very outset
compelled to construct storage tanks in order to accumulate
the surplus of the rain-water that had fallen during the wet
months, for the watering of the paddy fields in the dry
season. We may assume that Pandus were their teachers
and helpers in that task. This fact is pointed to by the tradi-
tion itself. For we learn from Mahavamsa 7.48 sq. that at
the request of Vijaya the Pandu king did not only send to
Ceylon maidens as wivesfor Vijaya and his companions,
but also workmen (pessiya-kdrake) and many families
of the various guilds, i.e. numerous artisans and
craftsmen who were able to assist the Aryans in their
undertakings. He probably hoped to extend his dominion
over the Island with the help of those Aryan adventurers as
pioneers. |

80. The first tanks in ancient times seer to have been
built by a group of families who were related with one
another. They cleared the forest and built near the tank
the huts which served as domicile for the single families.
Such was the origin of a primitive Sinhalese village commu-
nity (gama). But the fields attached to a village and watered
from the same tank, were not common property of the
families who had erected the tank, but were divided into

ayy

84 WILHELM GEIGER

shares, each being cultivated by one family. This type of
a Sinhalese village remained the same during the medizval
period.

Now in Mahavamsa 10.103 we come across the short
notice that king Pandukabhaya, about a century after the
first colonisation, fixed the village-boundaries over the
whole of the Island. This notice is important, for it seems to
mean that at an early time a certain land-tenure was estab-
lished in Ceylon which in course of centuries gradually
developed into the complicated system prevailing from the
mediseval period wp to the present time. It would be
beyond the scope of my work to enter into the details of
that system, for the knowledge of which H. W. Codring-
ton’s Ancient Land Tenure and Revenue, Colombo, 1938
(together with de Lanerolle’s criticism and comment in the
Journ. of the Roy. As. Soc., Ceylon Br. March, 1939) may
be consulted. It will be sufficient for our purpose to
elucidate the principles on which the whole system is based
and which are reflected in the historical facts and in the
administrative regulations.

The fundamental idea, according to my opinion was
the maxim that the king is the proprietor of the whole
land. It is from this point of view that the administration
of the kingdom becomes intelligible (cf. above 44 sq.,
].G.0.S., Vol. V. 1 sq.) Indeed, every progress of
cultivation is under royal control. No new tank can be
constructed nor any new village built without the permission
of the magistrates who are the substitutes of the king.
With this permission the king cedes a part of his property
to the colonists, but the latter do not become proprietors,
but only occupiers of the new colony. Not even timber
can be fetched from the ownerless forest or a chena
cultivation laid out in the wilderness without official sanc-
tion. The king may even present a villageto one of his
officials either as salary for his service or as reward for a
single meritorious action. In this case he cedes his own
rights concerning the village to the bhikkhu community or

&
'
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE MAHAVAMSA 85

to the official. But he nevertheless continues to be the
proprietor, for the privilege can be withdrawn, as soon as
it pleases the king. Lands dedicated to religious institu-
tions, however, were always service-free, and thus monas-
teries could become great landed proprietors.

81. There can be no doubt that a medizeval village
in Ceylon did not differ in appearance from a modern
jungle village situated in a district which is net much in-
fluenced by European civilisation. The attractive and
really charming picture of such a peaceful village drawn by
WW. Parker in the introduction to his Village Folk-tales
of Ceylon would also perfectly suit a village of the
medizeval period. Many centuries have passed without
altering the character of an Indian village and the life of
its inhabitants. The fields watered from the tank were a
pleasant oasis within the gloomy wilderness. The houses
or rather huts of the villagers were lying near the tank.
They were thatched with straw or plaited cocoanut leaves,
the walls made of clayed twigs. Each family had its own
house and round it a small garden with a few fruit-bearing
trees, cocoanut and arecapalms, bananas and mangoes.
The villages were generally open, but sometimes, when
they were infested by wild beasts, enclosed with a fence
of briers. On his way to Gajabahu’s kingdom prince
Parakkamabahu came to such a village. His companions
could not penetrate the enclosure, because it was full of
terrible prickles, but the prince broke fearlessly through
the fence and entered the village.

Villages in favourable situation could grow into market-
places (nigama) where the neighbouring villagers would
purchase from traders or craftsmen the articles necessary
for their work and daily life. The people living in such
larger villages were called negama, but this word is also
simply used as synonym with janapadd, country people in
contrast with the inhabitants of a town.

82. The number of tanks and rural settlements was
immense in Ceylon, and it appears to have been consider-

56 WILHELM GEIGER

ably larger at a certain period, at least, than itis at present.
Thousands of ruined or abandoned tanks have been dis.
covered in the wilderness and were mapped out by the
Survey, but the villages which aforetime stood near these
tanks have disappeared, and the fields which had been
watered from them are overgrown with jungle.

The apparent decline of agricultural activity has been
explained in different ways. Some assumed as its cause
the spreading of diseases like malaria, others catastrophes,
such as pernicious floods or lasting drought. The destruc-
tion of tanks happened, of course, often enough owing
either to an external accident or to the negligence of the
villagers. But] see the main problem notin the decay of
civilisation, but rather in the mere existence of such a vast
number of small tanks in the wilderness. This scems to
point to a temporary excess of population, but according
to my opinion it is connected with historical events, namely,
with the general insecurity and the political and economical
disturbance during the dynastic struggles after the death
of king Vijayabahu I (1114), and yet more after the invasion
and during the despotic rule of the usurper Magha (1214-
1233). have the impression that the destructive influence
of these events on Sinhalese civilisation has not been suffi-
ciently taken into account.

From the graphic description in Mahavamsa 6]. 48-72
and 80. 59-79 we learn that in those times the best culti-
vated districts of the Island were recklessly devastated by
an undisciplined soldiery who corrupted the good morals of
the family, took away with violence the possessions of the
wealthy people, and maltreated priests and laymen in
every way.

It was in these times of fearful disorder and anarchy,
I believe, that many families through fear of the persecu-
tion they had to suffer left their homes and fled into the
forest, just as others found refuge on inaccessible rocks
which they fortified. Since those who sought for security
in the jungle came in great numbers, but in small groups,

Rae es

e

i

'

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE MAHAVAMSA 87

they constructed many but small tanks where they hoped
to find subsistence for themselves and their families.

Thus quite a new class of people arose in Ceylon who
may aptly be called the ‘Tank colonists.’ These were the
Vannis. Itis certainly nota mere chance that this name
which seems to be connected with Vana ‘forest’ first occurs
in the chronicle in 81.17, just after the chapter in which
the misrule of Magha is described.

The tank colonists appear to have formed a separate
well-organised union within the kingdom. They had
their own headmen or ‘kings,’ and such Vanni kings existed
in Patittharattha (Northern Province) and in Rohana (South-
Eastern Province) and elsewhere (89. 51 sq.) i.e., wherever
there was jungle and forest. Vijayabahu III who later on
was the rival king of Magha is said to have for fear of the
foe withdrawn to inaccessible forests. He dwelled there
for a long time and attained the royal dignity among the
Vannis (81. 10 sq.).

In the period of the Sinhalese renaissance which set in
after the death of Magha and which is chiefly connected
with the names of Vijayabahu and Parakkamabahu II, the
latter king is said to have brought over tohis side all the
Vanni kings dwelling here and there in mountain and
wilderness (83. 10; 87. 26, 52). The Vanni headmen
swore allegiance also to his son Vijayabahu IV and
delivered over to him their royal insignia (88. 87-88). They
also collected a large quantity of victuals to offer them to
the Buddhist community (89. 51 sq.)

The meaning of these storiesis that in the thirteenth
century the Sinhalese kings after overcoming the external
foc did their utmost to restore the internal welfare of the
kingdom. Above all, it was necessary in the most produc-
tive districts of the Island to have cultivated anew the
fields laid waste during the times of disturbance. For this
purpose the assistance of skilful agriculturists was needed,
and hardly better helpers could be found than those tank
colonists who had learned to work: under the most difficult

88 WILHELM GEIGER

circumstances. The kings succeeded in bringing them
back from the wilderness and the small jungle tanks were
abandoned and neglected and gradually went to ruin.
Vannis are no longer mentioned in the chronicle after the
beginning of the fourteenth century. In 90. 105 the
successor of Parakkamabahu IV is called Vanni-Bhuvaneka-
bahu (about 1333). Itis obvious that he was the descen-
dant of one of those Vanni headmen.

Thus the construction of the numerous jungle tanks and
the Vannis found merely a romantic episode in the
cultural history of Ceylon. But of course not all the tank
colonists gave up their jungle life. Some of them remained
in the wilderness, chiefly those who had settled in the
remotest districts. There they became more and more
secluded fromthe other people and even quite isolated.
The last remnants are now the Vanniyds. I believe, there-
fore, in full accord with Mrs. Cook (C., p. 334) that the
Vanniyas by no means represent a separate race, but are
merely degenerated Sinhalese who for centuries were cut
off from all connexion with the civilisation. In the year
1887 (Parker in Tapr. Febr. 1887, p. 15 sq.) their number
was not more than 500 in all. Most of them are living in
the northern part of the North-Central Province in small
hamlets consisting of primitive huts. A few only cultivate
paddy, the rest live by chena cultivation, hunting and
honey-collection. Although the other people speak of
them as Veddas, they themselves entirely deny such a
descent and look down with contempt on the Veddas.
They are all Buddhists and generally speak the Sinhalese
language. In Rohana there are no Vanniyds, and it will
not be long before the last Vannis will have disappeared.

83. Towns (nagara, pura) could come into existence
where tanks of larger dimensions were constructed and an
area of greater extent became cultivable so that proportion-
ally more people were able to earn their livelihood in such
places. Butit is noticeable that, at least in the earlier
centuries of the medimval period, we hear very little of
oe

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE MAHAVAMSA 8&9

towns existing in Ceylon. A town like Devanagara, now
Dondra, is not mentioned before the eleventh century
(Mahavamsa 56. 6). No doubt a village began to get the
character of a town when it was fortified, and such
entrenched settlements may have existed here and there in
the Island. West of the Sigiri rock which wasa fortress
already inthe fifth century (39. 2-3) fortifications can be
traced which must have enclosed something like a town.
A more open city seems to have been situated east of the
rock, and south of it a very old fortification, the Mapagala,
with Cyclopean walls. Such town-like settlements became
more frequent after the turbulent times of the thirteenth
century. They were built at the foot of those isolated
rocks which served as refuge; the rock itself was the
citadel within the settlement. Such an entrenchment
exists at the foot of the Subhagiri, now Yapahu,
and the later towns as Jambuddoni (81. 15 sq.) (now
Dambadeniya) and Hatthigiripura (90.59) had a similar
character.

But if we are to describe a medizeval Sinhalese town,
we are confined to Anuradhapura and Pulatthinagara, now
Polonnaruva. Here was the residence of the Sinhalese
kings and the seat of the Government—in Anuradhapura, as
we can generally say, up to the Cola invasion at the end of
the tenth century, andin Pulatthinagara from the end of
the eleventh to the end of the thirteenth century. These
towns were embellished with splendid buildings by the
kings, the former chiefly by Dutthagamani already in pre-
Christian times, the latter by Parakkamabahu ]. We under-
stand, therefore, that the interest of the chroniclers was
entirely concentrated on them. .

84. According to the older Pali literature and the
Jatakas in Buddhist times the cities in India were rec-
tangular, usually square, with four gates, one in the middle
of each wall, facing the four quarters, and four main
streets led from these gates to the centre of the city (A. K.
Coomaraswamy, Eastern Art Il, 1930, pp. 211-12).

As the remnants of its ancient walls show, the plan of
the city of Anurddhapura wasthe same. It hadan extent
of about two-thirds of a mile from north to south and a
little less from east to west, forming a somewhat irregular
rectangle. The gates in the northern and southern walls
can be traced even now-a-days. The eastern gate appears
to have been approached from the ancient road which led
from Mihintale to Anuradhapura and crossed the Malvatu-
oya just near the middle of the eastern wall with a bridge
the remnants of which are still traceable.

Anuradhapura is, therefore, called catudvdra ‘having
four gates’ in Mahavamsa 34. 79 (cf. 35. 97). But the later
capital of the kingdom, Pulatthinagara, is also called
catudodra (88. 120) still in the 13th century, though the area
covered by its fortified city was double that of Anuradha-
pura city.

By the two main roads crossing each other in the centre
every old Indian city was divided into four districts. They
existed also in Pulatthinagara even at the time of the
greatest extent of the town. Parakkamabahu erected four
alms-halls in the four districts of the city (catusu passesu
purassa 73. 27).

We must, however, in Anuradhapura as well as in
Pulatthinagara, distinguish between the fortified city and
the parts of the town lying outside the entrenchment; the
former was comparatively small. Monasteries, for instance,
lay never in the city, but always outside as too much
ground was required for their temples and numerous other
buildings. In Anurddhapura four suburbs (dvdragama)
were laid out already by king Pandukabhaya (10. 88) and
in later times the Jetavandrama and the Mahavihara lay
south of the city, the Abhayagirivihara north of it. In
Pulatthinagara king Parakkamabahu i is said to have founded
three suburbs (sékha@nagara 73°152-3, 78°79-95). Their
names were Rajavesibhujanga, Sihapura or Rajakulantaka,
and Vijitapura. They were adorned with splendid palaces
and other buildings, and each with: a monastery erected by

the king: the first with the Isipatana-vihara, the second with
the Kusinara-vihdra and the third with the Veluvana-vihara.

In 73°159-163 we come across the notice that in the
twelfth century Parakkamabahu erected fourteen gates in
Pulatthinagara. This is by no means contradictory to what
we have said above concerning the four gates of Pulatthi-
nagara. For those gates erected by Parakkamabahu did not
belong to the city which had never more than four gates,
but were monumental structures built at the entrance of the
roads leading from all directions to the capital. It is said in
78°81 ,86,89 that in the suburb Rajavesibhujahga four gates
were erected, three in Sihapura, and fourin Vijitapura.
We may assume that the remaining three gates were to
adorn older suburbs which existed already before the time
of Parakkamabahu.

The names of the fourteen gates were |. King’s Gate,
2. Lion Gate, 3. Elephant Gate, 4. Indra Gate, 5. Hanu-
mant Gate, 6. Kuvera Gate, 7. Candi Gate, 8. Rakkhasa
Gate, 9. Serpent Gate, 10. Water Gate, 11. Garden Gate,
12. Maya Gate, 13. Mahatittha Gate, 14. Gandhabba Gate.
The name of the first gate also occurs in 74199. Through
it the holy Relics that had been retaken in Rohana were
brought into the town in a solemn procession. As the
relics came from the south, it is probable that the King’s
Gate (raéjadvdra) lay in this direction.

According to 73°156 Pulatthinagara in the twelfth
century had an extent of 4x7 gavutas=9 x 1534 inches (cf.
H.W. Codrington, Ceylon Journ. of Science, Sec. G. HI,
p- 129 sq., 134). This number does not refer, I believe, to
city and town alone, but included the whole cultivated area
belonging to it. The area which has been cleared and
excavated up to the present time amounts to four miles
from south to north, and two miles in its broadest portion
from west to east. The fortified city whichis still clearly
traceable, had an extent of one mile to half a mile.

85. The fortification of a city, mostly Pulatthinagara, is
mentioned and described in several passages of the chroni-

92 WILHELM GEIGER

cle. King Vijayabahu I, 1059-1114, is said in Mahavamsa
60°2-3 to have built in Pulatthinagara a high and strong wall
(pGkara) which was well-faced with stucco (sudhdkamma)
and defended round about with a long, broad and deep
moat (parikha). The new fortification, constructed by
Parakkamabahu (73°57 sq.), was yet stronger than that
built by former kings. The wall was high and covered with
a coating of stucco, and it was surrounded with three walls
more, apparently earth-walls, each in turn lower than the
others and each separated from the next one by a moat.
The fortress Parakkamapura, erected by Lankapura, one of
Parakkamab&hu’s generals, immediately on the coast oppo-
site Ramissara, was also enclosed with three walls, made of
stone (pdsdnamaya), and surrounded by three moats which
were filled with water flowing from ocean to ocean
{76° 121-23). |

It is noticeable that this description agrees with the
Kautaliya (trel. Shamasastry, p. 57) according to which a
castle must be surrounded with three moats, each narrower
than the other. The dug-out soil will have served for build-
ing the three walls mentioned in the Mahavamsa. In a
gloss Jat. IV. 106°", also three successive external moats,
surrounding a fortress, are mentioned, one within the other.
They are called udaka-, kaddama- and sukkha- parikha,
water-moat, mud-moat and dry moat (cf. for this and the
following remarks, A. K. Coomaraswamy, op. cif., p. 213).

The supposition is not excluded that the chronicler has
taken his description of fortifications rather from the litera-
ture he had studied than from actual conditions. But we
must point to the fact that the great triple entrenchment
(timah@parikha) also occurs in the old Mahavamsa 25°48,
with reference to a city called Mahelanagara.

The four gates (dodra) of a city required, of course, the
strofigest fortification. - Wherever in the chronicle the taking
by storm of a fortress. is narrated, the gates are the chief
objects of the attack. The city of Mahelanagara, just men-
tioned, possessed but one gate and was therefore hard to
*

come at. Some words denoting chiefly parts of the gate-
ramparts—gopura, torana, kotthaka, attaéla, patthandila—
demand a short explanation (cf. A. K. Coomaraswamy,
Early Indian Architecture, |. Cities and City gates, op. cit.,
p- 209 sq.).

The word gopura is not a mere synonym of dvdra. The
difference of meaning is manifest in 51.34. When the
Senpati of king Sena II, 850-885, who was at war with the
Pandus, had surrounded Madhura, he first blockaded the
gates (duGrdni), and cut off all traffic, then he set fire to
gopur’-atiala-kotthake. Therefore, dvdra simply denotes
the entrance, but gopurais the tower-like structure above
the gate. Such structures could also be erected in inter-
vals on the top of the wall; twelve gopuras stood, for ins-
tance, on the wall of the fortress Parakkamapura (76.122).
Perhaps the general translation fower is preferable to the
more frequently used ‘gate-house.’ By forana (36-]03)
is meant the arch, against which gate-leaves closed from
behind. The town Kalyani is said in 91.5 to have had
splendid towers and arches. Often toranas are triumphal
arches erected in the Streets at a festive occasion, to be
passed by the festive procession (74.200).

The substantive koithaka signifies any room for keeping
valuable things, a treasury or a granary or the like. In
connection with gopura or dudra (51.34; 91.7) it is a shelter-
ed room in the gate-tower from which the defenders could
throw missiles or stones or frebrands on the heads of the
enemies who tried to break through the gate-leaves or had
succeeded in doing so. 1 propose to translate the word
with shelter. The attdla (ka)s or bastions, as ] translate the
word, are according to A.K. Coomaraswamy structures
projecting from the walls right and left of the actual
gateway. They were manned in case of necessity with
soldiers who were able to protect the entrance from both
sides.

Difficult to explain is the word patthandila, which is met
with in one passage only (60.3). Since the walls of Pula-

94 WILHELM GEIGER

tthinagara are equipped with high patthandilas | suppose
that parapets are meant behind which the defenders are
guarded against the rain of arrows shot by the aggressors,
when they are preparing the attack.

86. Towns with their streets (vithi =Sk. id., raccha
carriage-road=5Sk. rathya) are depicted in the Indian lite-
rature in a schematic manner. In Pulatthinagara there were
many hundreds of streets with thousands of dwellings
(alaya) of two, three, and more storeys; in the streets
there was day by day an incessant traffic of elephants,
horses and carriages (Mahavamsa 73.148-49). When prince
Parakkamabahu intended secretly to leave the town and
to return to the Southern Province, he ran as if in fun after
his elephant and roamed from street to street (racchdya
raccham vicaram 67.33). He thus deceived the people
concerning his intention and the direction of his flight.
The principal street of a town was called King’s street
(rajavithi 67.1).

The words for dwelling-houses are geha, ghara, dgdra.
Peculiar types of houses were addhayoga and hammiya
(88.93, 118), but we are unable to describe their architectural
character. Hammiya was perhaps a house with a pavilion
on its top which could serve as an abode in the bright
season, for the word is also used as designation for one of
the outside chambers of a palace (A.K. Coomaraswamy;,
Eastern Art Ul, 1931, p. 191). Both words occur in the
Vinaya 1 58°, I] 146 in an enumeration of the buildings
which are allowed to bhikkhus as dwelling-places; vihdGra,
addhayoga, pasdda, hammiya, guhd.

Houses with more than one storey are called pdsdda.
The most imposing of the palaces was, of course, that of the
king, The pasa@da built by Parakkamabahu in the citadel
of his capital is described above (20, J.G.1.S. Ill, 1936,
p. 141). For such buildings the translation ‘palace’ is
appropriate, but there can be no doubt that many houses
denoted with the expression pdsida were by no means
palaces in the modern sense of the word.

Certain streets of the town were reserved for the bazaar.
There stood the taverns (pana) and the shops (Gpana 91.5)
where victuals, fruit and fish could be bought or clothes
and ornaments or other articles manufactured by the arti-
sans. In the bazaars (antarapana) of Pulatthinagara all
wares (sabbopakarana) were to be had (73.149).

The main embellishments of a town were the parks
{uyyana). They were, of course, mostly outside the city.
In ancient Anuradhapura the parks Nandanavana and
Mahameghavana are frequently mentioned in the chronicle.
The latter was laid out by king Mutasiva (11.2) and granted
by king Devainampiyatissa to the thera Mahinda who
founded the first Buddhist monastery there, the Mahavihara
(15.1 sq.). In the Nandanavana which was also called
Jotivana (15.202) the Jetavanavihara was erected in the
4th century A. Cc. (37.33). The form of the name Maha-
meghavanuyyana (15.8) appears to prove that such
parks were originally forests (cana) which were cleared so
much as to become pleasure-gardens, where the people
could find recreation and amusement.

When Parakkamabahu was building his capital
Pulatthinagara, he laid outin the four districts charming
gardens (uyydna) with trees that bore abundant blossom
and fruit (73.28-9). They covered, of course, no large area.

Another park, laid down by the same king, was the
Nandanagarden, so named after the park of Anuraddhapura.
It is called ‘house-garden’ (gharayydna 73.95), but we see
from 101-2 that it was open to the public. The charm of
this park is praised by the chronicler in the most extolling
manner, but quite schematically. There were pavilions
and other buildings of that kind in the park. It was
adorned with all the blossoming and fruit-bearing trees and
shrubs growing inthe island, and filled with the cry of
peacocks and the gentle twitter of birds. There were lakes
(sara) in the park whose chief decorations were red and
blue lotus flowers, and bathing ponds, named Silapokkharani
and Mangala-pokkharani, Stone-pond and Lucky pond. As

Bb WILHELM GEIGER

according to 73.95 this park was near the royal palace we
might assume thatthe garden in the northern half of the
citadel is meant. But in this case the whole description
would be hardly more than a poetical fiction, perhaps an
imitation of some older model.

In a similar manner as the Nandana-park the Dipuyyana,
‘Island-park’ is described (73.113 sq.). It is generally
assumed that it was laid out on the so-called ‘Promontory’
which juts out in the Tépavava west of the citadel and on
which the ruins of a series of magnificently constructed
baths were excavated by Mr. H. C. P. Bell in the year 1901.
Don M. de Z. Wickremasinghe, Epigraphia Zeylanica ,
p. 148.

According to the Mahavamsa the park had received its
name, because the water divided there into two arms which
enclosed the park like unto an island. It is however
difficult to make this agree with the actual situation.

87. Great was the number of public buildings erected
in a town chiefly for charity purposes. They are generally
called sala ‘halls’. This word is very comprehensive and
denotes quite different buildings. Common to them is the
fact that they do not serve a single family as lodging. A
peculiar form was catussald or catussdlaghara, the house
with four halls. Such an edifice stood inthe Mahavihara
in Anuraddhapura (Mahavamsa 15.47, 50; 35. 88) and
another since the time of king Mahadsena, 4the. A. ¢., in
the Abhayagirivihdra (37.15). By Parakkamabahu a
catussala with four entrances (cafummukha) and several
large halls (visdla-ndna@-sdla) was erected in the middle of
the town (73.23). It seems to have been a square court,
surrounded on all sides with halls open to the interior; the
four entrances opened from outside into the square. But
we do not know which purpose the building had to serve.
A catussalaghara within the fortress of Parakkamapura
(76.123) apparently contained barracks for the soldiers.

Near the entrances of the town Ggantusdalds were erected
as rest-houses for Reople. who had come from the country as

visitors or buyers (79.80.}. It seems that the halls with
maintenance (saha bhogena sdlayo 37.149) erected by king
Buddhadasa, inthe 4th c. a.c. on the high-street (mahd-
pathe) were also such rest-houses for travellers.

In order to commit criminals to custody dungeons
(k@rGgara) were built in the cities (70.264).

The dhammasdlds, mentioned arnong the buildings of
Pulatthinagara in the thirteenth century (88.93) were, as the
name indicates, halls in which the priests preached the
doctrine. For distributing charity among bhikkhus and
beggars alms-halls (ddnesdala@) were erected, as, for ins-
tance, one in Anurddhapura by king Mahinda lV, 10th c.
(54.30), Parakkamabahu had four alms-houses built in the
four districts of Pula tthinagara (73.26), and near these halls
he had laid down the four gardens mentioned above, and
setup rich provender houses which contained the most
necessary victuals, such as syrup, sugar, honey and the like
—-allfor the good of the monks and beggars entertained
in the alms-houses. He is also said to have erected an
alms-hall with four entrances (catummukha) on the spot
where his general Rakkha, carried off during the campaign
in Rehana by an attack of dysentery, had been burnt, in
order to honour his memory (74,150).

Often hospitals are mentioned among the public build-
ings of a town, the term vejjasdald, lit. doctor-house cecur-
ring first, as far as 1 can see, in the reien of Buddhadasa in
the fourth century A. c. (37.145. Buddhadasa also built
halls for cripples (pithasappin) and blind men on different
places (37.148), and the same was done by Udaya I, 792-97
(49.19). King Dhatusena had halls erected for lame and
sick people (pangu, rogdiura, 38.42). The building of an
hospital in Pulatthinagara is ascribed to the kings Udaya |
(49.19) and Sena I, 831-51, and that of one on the Atiya-
mountain (Mihintale)- to the latter’s successor Sena II
(50.74.; 51.73). Sena Kanga, the Senapati of king Kassapa
IV, 896-913, had two hospitals built in Anuradhapura and
Pulatthinagara for combating the upasagga disease (52.25).

rn WILHELM GEIGER

By the son of king Mahinda lV, 10th c., and by his Sena-
pati two separate hospitals were instituted, one for the laity
and the other for sick bhikkhus outside the town (54,53);
the king himself is said to have distributed medicaments
and beds to all the hospitals (54.31).

It was matter of course that Parakkamabahu also built a
great hospital in Pulatthinagara. It was large enough for
many hundreds of sick persons, and the king assigned to it
slaves male and female, as attendants, and provided for it,
according to need, medicine and food piled up in a store-
house (73.34-37).

Women in labour found accommodation in lying-in
hospitals (sitighara 79.61). In the old Mahavamsa 10.10 we
meet with a sivikd-sald, i.e., a lying-in shelter (cf. W.Geiger,
Mahavamsa trsl., p. 75, n. 3) even in the time of Panduka-
bhaya in the fourth century B. C. |

For sick people who could walk, dispensaries (bhesajja-
ghara 52.24.) were erected. Medicaments were distributed
here to them, no doubt without payment, for it was consi-
dered to be a work of charity and a merit.

The expenses of the hospitals were covered by the
munificence of the kings and other rich people. King
silakala, 6th c., is said to have increased the revenues of
(all) the hospitals in the island (41.28). King Udaya I pro-
vided each of the two hospitals erected by him in Pulatthi-
nagara and Padavi with a maintenance village (49.18), and
Kassapa V, 10th c., the hospital he had built in Anuradha-
pura (52.57), Mahinda IV is said to have instituted a
tambiila-mandapa, i.e. a shop where betel was sold to the
people, the earnings from which he made over to bhikkhus
for the purchase of medicines (54.46).

Early Traces of Buddhism in Burma
(Concluded from JGIS, VI, p. 32}
By Dr. NinarR-RANIAN Ray
VI.

The Buddhaghosa Tradition : Legend and Hisiory
C. 400-456 A.D.

We have already pushed the history of Theravada
Buddhism back to the 5th century A.D. The Buddhaghosa
tradition may now seem somewhat admissible.

Burmese chroniclers preserve a strong and persistent
tradition current to this day everywhere in the Buddhist
hierarchy of Burma that Buddhaghosa, the celebrated
PRuddhist commentator and author of Buddhist scriptures,
was a native of Burma. Born in Thaton he is said to have
made a voyage to Ceylon in the year of Religion 943,
400 a.D.1. The Burmese ascribe a new era in their reli-
gion to the time when the great scholar reached their
country back from Ceylon.” He succeeded in his under-
taking. He made use of the Burmese or rather Talaing
characters in transcribing the manuscripts which were
written in the character of Magadha. The Burmese lay much
stress on that voyage, always carefully noting down the
year it took place. In fact, it is to Buddhaghosa that the
people of the shores of the Gulf of Martaban owe the
possession of Buddhist scriptures.” He is said to have
also brought over from Ceylon to Burma a copy of Kacca-
yana’s Pali grammar which he translated into Burmese, and

to have written a commentary as well upon it.* A volume
of parables in Burmese is also attributed to him.” The
Burmese Code of Manu is said to have been introduced into
Burma from Ceylon by the same Buddhist scholar. But the
Code itself is silent on the point.®

Here is an example how the tradition is recorded in the
chronicles of the country. [tis taken from the Hmannan
Yazawin which, like most other Burmese chronicles, claims
Buddhaghosa to have been a native of Thaton from where
he is said to have crossed over to a seaport called Bhangiri
in the Deccan. Thence he reached Ceylon by ship. It
then proceeds to give an account of his early life and career,
and his sojourn in Ceylon including the story of the writing
of the commentaries; these accounts follow on the whole
those of the Ceylonese chronicles.

‘Thus when the great elder Ashin Buddhaghosa had
given king Mahanaman a white elephant and sought leave
to depart, he brought one out of the three copies of the
Visuddhimagga which he had made together with the three
Pitakas, and crossed over to Jambudwipa. And Sakra came
to him and said: ‘In Jambudwipa, in the middle country,
there is no standing place for the Religion. The Religion
should shine. The Religion shall stand and shine for five
thousand years in such places as the distant jungle settle-
ments in the south-east corner of the middle country, nine
hundred (yojana) in circumference—Tharebkittara, Thiri-
pyissaya, (and) Ramafifiadesa. Carry it thither! So he
took it and crossed over and reached the city of Thaton,
called Sudhammavati. And when the tidings were known,
there was a general cry throughout all the kingdom of
Ramaiifia, and king and queen, men and women, monks

and laymen, all welcomed the Religion with divers festi-
vals, assembles, celebrations, and almsgivings. As though
the Lord Omniscient had appeared in their midst, they
reverently raised the Pitakas, and coming to the city palace
they built a tabernacle in a lovely place in front of the
golden palace, and there they laid the treasures of the
religion.

‘* At the time the chief elder of the Religious order was
Ashin Anomadassi. This is his lineage: of the two monks
of the Third Council, Sona and Uttara, who came to
Savannabhiimi in the cause of religion, Ashin Sona the
elder had ten pupils who abode with him, the chief of
whom was Ashin Mahasobhita;—his pupil was Ashin
Mahasomadatta; his pupil, Ashin Sumantissa; his pupil,
Ashin Sobhaga; his pupil, Ashin Somadatta; his pupil,
Ashin Anomadassi. When Ashin Anomadassi was in
charge of the Religion, divers saints and monks who were
practising piety in the countries of Burma, Mon, Arakan,
Shan Yun, Linzin and Sokkati, came one by one and studi-
ed and took away the sacred Pali and the commentary,
which had only been handed down by word of mouth
from teacher to teacher; and so in divers distant places
even now the Religion spreads and shines. This agrees
with the Sdsanavamsa and the Thaton Chronicle......

Panenoes The Great Chronicle says that it was in the forty-
second year after the accession of King Thinlikyaung that
Ashin Buddhaghosa crossed over to Ceylon. But in the
forty-fourth (2?) year of the reign of this king, being the
930th year of the Religion or 308, Mahanaman had not even
come tothe throne; there is a gap of sixteen years. So it
was not in the reign of king Thinlikyaung, but in the
fifteenth year of the reign of his son Kyaungdwit that
Mahanaman became king, in the 946th year of the Religion
or 324. This is found in the Dipavamsa and agrees with
the Kalyani inscriptions, and the Sdsanavamsa.

‘The above account has been omitted in the Great and
Middle Chronicles, but is here inserted with extracts accord-

102 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

ing to the books, in order to make plain the story of the
arrival in Burma of the Pitakas, of the Religion.”’

Thus so far as legend is concerned which obviously is
an example of how the chroniclers of a later date satisfied
their natural vanity by claiming as many celebrities of the
Religion they could as their own. Foulkes’ and Smith®
even doubted if there was ever ahistorical personage as
Buddhaghosa. But we can readily ignore that argument
now, for the celebrated Buddhist scholar has long been
proved to have been a real historical personage. More
substantial arguments in opposition are, however, offered
by Prof. Hackmann and Prof. Louis Finot.

‘There is ground” says Prof. Hackmann’, ‘for doubting
the statement that this man (Buddhaghosa) brought
Buddhism to Burma. The chronicles of Ceylon to which
we owe the information about Buddhaghosa and which
must have been well-informed on the subject, give no
account of his journey to Further India. Indeed, one of the
most important inscriptions in Burma, which was erected
at the end of the [5th century A.D. at the instance of
the king of Pegu...makes no mention whatsoever of
Buddhaghosa. The Burmese tradition which refers to him
does so on account of his translations and writings having
become fundamental in the country, probably also because
his intellectual influence may have inaugurated a new
epoch in Burmese Buddhism.”

Prof. Finot, the distinguished French scholar, also
speaks in the same strain.

“In Indo-China, he (Buddhaghosa) passes for the grand
apostle who brought to those peoples the treasure of the
sacred books. Each country of the Peninsula is a claimant;
the Burmese make him a monk of Thaton, modern

Cambodia places him at the beginning of its religious
tradition and has kept his name as one of the most elevated
titles of ecclesiastical hierarchy...... The (Burmese) chroni-
cles either secular or ecclesiastical are only the echo of
Simhalese history, altered by an insatiable national vanity.
As they make Buddha travel in the valley of the lrrawady
for predicting the foundation of diverse capitals, they
substitute Thaton for Magadha as the point of departure or
of return in the voyage of Buddhaghosa to Ceylon. Not
only is this tradition apocryphal, it is not even old; it
cannot go back in any case further than the 16th century.
We have a decisive proof of it in the inscriptions of
Kalyani......If the belief in the introduction of the scriptures
to Pegu by Buddhaghosa had asserted at that time, the
pious king would have no doubt reserved to it a place of
honour in his abridgement of the history of the Church.
But he does not mention the name of the great commen:
tator; thus it follows that in his time no connection had yet
been established between Buddhaghosa and Thaton.*”

Who would deny thatthere is great weight in these
criticisms which are just and reasonable? The character
itself of the tradition is suchas to raise suspicion in a
critical mind; and the omission, moreover, of any account
of the great scholar’s adventure in Further India in the
Ceylonese chronicles as well as in the Kalyani inscriptions
is indeed too serious an objection to overcome. The
argument of omission, it is true, is another example of
argumenitum ex silentio, but it must be admitted that in
the present instance it goes a great way towards confirming
our suspicions already created in the mind by the nature
of the tradition itself. The omission in the Ceylonese
chronicles, may, however, be ignored; but not that in the
Kalyani inscriptions where the pious and zealous king
Dhammaceti made it a point, as it were, to record each

and every step in the course of the progress of the Religion
in the Peninsula up till his reign, and it is indeed difficult
to assume that he forgot to record such an important
event.

Furthermore, Prof. B. M. Barua’* has recently introduced
us to a second Buddhaghosa, a Buddhist scholar and
divine, and an elder contemporary of the Buddhaghosa of
Visuddhimagga fame. Evidence, unfortunately, is so
meagre on the point that itis very difficult to establish his
identity; we only know that it was at his instance that the
younger, but the more celebrated, Buddhaghosa undertook
to prepare his famous commentary on the Vibhanga the
Sammohavinodini. It may be argued that the elder
Buddhaghosa may have been a native of Burma, and the
chroniclers fathered on him all that passedin the name of
the younger and the more celebrated one. But such an
assumption is unwarranted; and if all that is claimed by
the tradition current in Burma is to be believed, it is certain
that none else than the younger and the more celebrated,
the scholar Buddhaghosa, is meant.’”

But al] this is more destructive or speculative. The
tradition so loud and persistent, may not be without a
meaning, a significance. Is it not possible to suggest some-
thing constructive, something that may help us to see the
indication of history through the thick mass of legends?

12. “The Burmese tradition that Buddhaghosa was a native of
Thaton and returned thither from Ceylon merits more attention than
it has received. It can easily be explained away as patriotic fancy.
On the other hand, if Buddhaghosa’s object was to invigorate
Hinayanism in India. the result of his really stupendous labours was
singularly small, for in India his name is connected with no teligious
movement. But if we suppose that he went to Ceylon by way of
the holy places in ‘Magadha and returned from the Coromandel coast
to Burma where Hinayanism afterwards flourished, we have at least
a coherent narrative.” Eliot, Hinduism and Buddhism, Ul, p. 32.

We may not be able to hit upon any positive evidence,
4 but we may be able to throw, in more or less degree, some
light on a tradition that has vexed scholars for long.

Recent archaeological finds mainly at Hmawza,; a small
village rich in ancient ruins, five miles south of the present
town of Prome, and the oldest seat, so far known, of
i kingship in Lower Burma, have decisively proved that
Theravada or Pali Buddhism was already well known in
and around that country in the fifth and sixth centuries of
the Christian era. Here have been discovered a number
of epigraphs relating to well-known texts from canonical
Pali literature inscribed on stone and gold plates in. what
is very Closely allied to the Kadamba script, paleographi-
cally belonging to the 5th, 6th centuries A.D. Two of
these plates begin with the well-known Buddhist formula
“Yedhamma hetuppabhava.....,’’ etc., in Pali, and refer
: respectively to the 19 categories of Buddhism, and the
x equally well-known praise of the tri-raina as contained in
" the Anguttara Nikaya.’’ Another epigraph contains an
extract either from the Dhammasafigani or Vibhahtga; 9 i
while a third which is a gold-leaf manuscript is inscribed =o oe

Buddha in traditional poses and attitudes and belonging
to the same period, as well as stiipas and other monuments,
belonging to the creed of Theravada Buddhism by reason
of the iconography of their sculptures, have been discovered
in considerable numbers at the same locality. These find-
ings known to scholars for several years are important by
themselves, but when we consider the period to which they
belong and the tradition of art and palaeography to which
they are affiliated on the one hand, and on the other the
period when Buddhaghosa flourished and the country or
countries which he was more or less associated with, they
become at once invested with a deeper significance.

According to Dhammakitti’s account in the Mahdvamsa,
Buddhaghosa flourished in the first half of the 5th century
A.D. This account is supported by Burmese tradition
and other internal evidences from the works of Buddha-
ghosa himself.** Most of his years of activity he lived, it
ig true, in Ceylon, but tradition strongly connects him with
South India as well, more definitely with Conjeeveram or
ancient Kaficipuram which the great Buddhist scholar and
preacher is credited with having developed into an im-
portant centre of Theravada Buddhism. Tradition and
history also associate him intimately with the Godavari
region on the one hand, and the Kaveri region on the
other. In fact, if tradition is to be given any value, it is
to the credit of Buddhaghosa that Theravada Buddhism
had a new lease of life in South India.

Now, we have seen in the preceding sections, that from
the fifth century onwards down to the middle of the ele-
venth there is a continuous record of a very flourishing state
of Buddhism in and around the kingdom of Old Prome, in
fact, in Lower Burma. The fifth century indeed seems to
be very significant, from what we have already seen, in
the history of Buddhism in Burma; this century saw, in
the old kingdom: of Prome, a sudden awakening of

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 107

Theravada Buddhism, a new start, as it were, of an old
faith. It found from somewhere a strong impetus, a new
urge of life, at about this period; and this new urge ex-
pressed itself in a wide outburst of activities in all direc-
tions, chips of which have come down to us in the shape
of a number of Pali inscriptions, a large number of
Buddhist sculptures, and a few Buddhist monuments. Is it
or is it not possible to connect this impetus, this outburst
of religious activities, suddenly in about the fifth century,
with the Buddhaghosa legend? In any case the appearance
or re-appearance of Theravada Buddhism in the old king-
dom of Prome, as evidenced by her old epigraphs and
sculptures and monuments thus almost coincides not only
with the period in which Buddhaghosa flourished, but also
with the establishment and development of great centres
of Theravada Buddhism on the Krsna-Godavari and Kaveri
valleys, places like (Kaficipuram, Kaveripattanam and
Uragapuram, all intimately associated with the Buddhaghosa
tradition. The coincidence seems rather to be significant,
and when we examine the Burmese tradition from this point
of view the story of the great scholar’s visit may not seem
to be altogether without a foundation, though one is con-
scious that such an argument involves a certain kind of
logical fallacy.

With regard to the Buddhaghosa tradition the position
may, therefore, be stated thus: There are, indeed, cogent
reasons for doubting it, but we must not treat the prob-
lem as closed or as decided once for all. There is, indeed,
a probability of the tradition having something to do with
actual facts, and it is, therefore, more reasonable to keep the
door open for more light, and re-examine the legend in the
light of evidences that are daily growing in volume and
importance in favour of an ‘early introduction of Thervada
Buddhism in Burma. But Buddhaghosa or no Buddhaghosa
in Burma, it is immaterial with regard to our study of the
history of Buddhism in the Peninsula. If the tradition be
given any value, the great Buddhist scholar must then have

108 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

made his influence felt in Burma some time in the first half
of the fifth century a.p. If it is dismissed, it would matter
little, for almest immediately after, we have definite epigra-
phic evidence of the prevalence of Theravada Buddhism,
the religion of the Master, in its pure and unsullied form, in
Lower Burma where Buddhagosa is said to have established
one of his centres of activity.

VI
Buddhism in Lin-Yang (Prome >) C. 250 A.D.

The Pali epigraphs discovered in the old city of Prome
and belonging to the fifth and sixth centuries are not how-
ever the earliest evidence of Buddhism in Burma. Still
earlier, already in the third century of the Christian era,
Buddhism was well established in a part of Burma where
there were several thousand ‘‘Sramanas adhering to the
faith’’, and where the people ‘‘worshipped the Buddha.”

Early Chinese texts speak often of a country, among a
host of others of Indo-China, called Chin-lin or ‘‘Frontier of
Gold’’. Prof. Paul Pelliot long ago drew our attention to

these texts, and it is to him that we are mostly indebted for

all information from Chinese sources regarding Far-Eastern
countries including Campa, Kamboja, Siam, Laos, Java,

Sumatra, Borneo and other islands, Burma and even some
parts of Eastern India. Here we shall concern ourselves

with only a few references from eaincses texts which may
directly refer to our subject.”

About the beginning of the third century A.D. Fii-nan
which included modern Cambodia and major portion of
Siam, was gradually expanding its power. One of its kings,
(Fan-) wan, a brave and capable man, attacked and subdued
the neighbouring kingdoms and took the title of the Great

King of Fii-nan. He then boarded a few great ships and
traversing the vast ocean attacked more than ten kingdoms
including Ch’u-tu-kun, Chin-chih and Tien-siin, thus extend-
ing the kingdom of Fii-nan five or six thousand li. Then he
projected a subjugation of the kingdom of Chin-lin or Fron-
tier of Gold; but as he fell ill, he could not achieve his
end.' The date of the death of (Fan-}wan, the Great King
of Fii-nan, is shown by Pelliot to have been c. 225-30 A.p. 7
Moreover, in the time of Wu (4.D. 222-80), Chu Ying and
K’ang Y’ai, Prof. Pelliot points out, were sent on an em-
bassy to the country of (Fan)-hsun. The date of this em-
bassy is fixed by him to have been c. 245-250 A.D.** ‘‘The
kingdoms which they passed through or heard of, were a
hundred and several tens’”’;'® but the evidence as given in
the Liang Shu (ch. 54, £. 2 recto and verso) does not warrant
such a long list. It includes Tu-K’un, Chu-li, Tun-Hsun and
Chin-lin;?? Tu-K’un and Chu-l must be looked for some-
where in the Malay Peninsula, Tun-Hsun (Tien-siin) has
been identifed with Tennasserim, and Chin-lin or the Fron-
tier of Gold with Suvannabhiimi of Pali literature. The
identification of the last-named country is generally accept-
ed.*? Chin-lin thus refers to the region of the Gulf of

Martaban which is certainly the same as the ‘great bay of

the Frontier cof Gold’ referred to in the Chinese texts.”

The kingdom of Chin-lin was called Chin-ch’en. The
T’ai-p'ing yu lan (ch. 790, £. 23) has two quotations, Pelliot
points cut, about the kingdom of the Frontier of Gold. The
first is taken from I wu chih according to which Chin-lin is
called Chin-ch’en. It is above 2000 li from Fii-nan. The
second extract is taken from the Wai kuo ch'uan according
to which one can reach Chin-ch’en by going west for more
than 2000 li from Fii-nan. Pelliot sees in Chin-ch’en a gra-
phic alteration of Chin-lin.?? That the two are identical is
also proved by Prof. Luce who points out that “‘the variants
Chin-lin and Chin-ch’en, both perhaps of equal antiquity,
are sufficiently close in sound to suggest that the name may
be a transcription, and not a translation, of the native
names; and this would explain the variant writings of lin,
one of which, Chin-lin, has no semantic value...... If the
I wu chi is the Nan chou i wu chih of Wan chen, the
identificatin of Chin-ch’en with Chin-lin is as old as the third
century; the name Chin-ch’en is also said to occur in the
Wai Kuo ch’uan which may be the actual work of K’ang
Tai (BEFEO, 1904, p. 270, n. 3), and in the fifth century
Fii-nan chi of Chu Chih’’*

It is in the last named text, i. e. the Fii-nan chi of Chu
Chih that there is an interesting reference to what may be
said to bear an important relation with our present subject

of Martaban. Chin-ch’en, or Chin-lin, is said to be more than 2000 I
west of Fii-nan; Pieu-ton, Tu-Koun, Chu-li and Pi-Sung are 3000 li
south of Chin-lin on the one hand; Tu-K’un and Tun-hsiin over 3000
ii south of Fii-nan on the other. It seems a natural conclusion that
Tu-K’un, etc. were- somewhere on the Malay Peninsula, roughly equi-
distant from (the capital of ?) Fii-nan (Cambodia) on the one side, and
the Gulf of Martaban’ on the other. The mention of the ‘great bay’
is a strong argument; and the reference to the white population of
these parts tallies with Peolemy s similar account of Chryse.”

of study. And here is Pelliot’s version of the portion of the
text as quoted in the Shui Ching Chu (ch. I, /. 7, verso):
‘The kingdom of Lin-Yang (old pronunciation: Liem- (d)
iang) is 2000 li by land-route from that of Chin-ch’en. One
goes there by carriage or on horseback; there is no route
by water. All the people worship the Buddha.’ This
kingdom of Lin-Yang is the object of a paragraph in the
T’ai p’ing yu lan (ch. 787, f. 13); it is mentioned according
to the report of the travels of K’ang T’ai, as being 7000 li
south-west of Fii-nan, and according to the Nan Chouiwu
chi of Wan Chen, as being the same distance, but west. In
the time of K’ang T’ai there were already in this country,
according to his report, several thousand Sramanas.’’**
K'ang T’ai, according to Pelliot, should be referred to the
middle of the third century A.D. It is thus evident that
Buddhism was already a flourishing religion at that time in
the kingdom of Lin-Yang. But which is the region referred
to as Lin-Yang in the Chinese texts ?

The kingdom of Lin-Yang is said to be 2000 li by horse
or carriage from Chin-ch’en or Chin-lin which is Suvanna-
bhiimi or Thaton region of Burma on the Gulf of Martaban.
Chin-lin again is said to be of the same distance to the west
from Fii-nan that included modern Cambodia and the major
portion of Siam. From Fii-nan, Lin-Yang was, however,
7000 Ji to the west or south-west. From these data as well as
from the statement that it could not be reached by water,
Prof. Luce infers that Lin-Yang might have been situated

25. How unreliable are these measurements of distances as given.
in these texts is apparent in this statement. From Fii-nan Chin-lin
is described to be 2000 4 and from Chin-lin to Lin-Yang the distance
is the same. The two distance lines thus form the two arms or sides
of equal length of a triangle whose third side may be said to be supplied
by the distance line of 7000 4 from Fii-nan to Lin-Yang, an impossible
proposition from the geometrical point of view. For the third side
(7000 fi) cannot be greater in any case than the other two sides taken
together, viz. 4ooo fi. me

112 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

in the north or centre of Burma.*® But I cannot really
follow why Lin-Yang should be located so high up in the
Peninsula as in the north, though one may possibly be dis-
posed to locate itin the centre. It is difficult to ascertain
from where all distances in respect of Fii-nan were counted;
was it from the capital or from the nearest borderland? and
what again should be our attitude with regard to the distan-
ces and directions as stated in the texts which are our only
source of information? Should we interpret them literally
or accept merely their sense? That they are sometimes
absolutely unreliable is well known. These are some of the
difficulties with respect to any identification of Lin-Yang;
but let us go by the facts as they are stated. If, then, the
identification of Chin-ch’en or Chin-lin with the Thaton
region is correct, and Prof. Luce admits that it is so, the
capital of Fii-nan from where presumably all distances in
respect of that country were counted or the nearest border
region of that kingdom, must be situated. on the authority
of the | wu chih as quoted in the T’ai ping yu lan referred
to above, some 2000 li east of Thaton.®” The distance of
Lin-Yang from Chin-ch’en is also stated as 2000 li, but the
direction is not given. It cannot, however, be southwards
from Chin-ch’en, for that way stretches the Malaya Peninsu-
la which borders on the sea, nor can it be direct westwards
from Thaton. According to Cunningham’s computation
one Chinese li in Heiian-Chuang’s time was equivalent to

26. . JBRS., Vol. XIV, Part Il, p..154.

27. The capital of Fii-nan was at T’e-mu, and was 500 H from
the sea, evidently the South China Sea. We should, therefore,
search for it somewhere, probably on the Mekong up Vien Tiane.
Pelliot would, however, locate it between Chandone and Phnom-penh,
perhaps near Vyadhapura (Angkor Borei). BEFEO, 1902, p. 128:
1903, Pp. 247, 269-90; 1904, p. arg. The difficulry with regard to
the identification is that Chin-lin is not due west from such a loca-
tion; the distance too is more than 500 Ui,

aot TSE SHEENRU DEERE oo

one-sixth of an English mile;** if it is assumed that Chinese
li measured the same distance in the third century as well,
we have roughly over 300 English miles as the distance from
Chin-ch’en or Thaton to Lin-Yang. But this distance must
not be measured as the crow flies, for cart or horse tracks in
those days lay necessarily in a zigzag course. Nor should
they, I think, be taken too literally. If we take this
into consideration and allow some concession as to the
measurement of the distance in li, | think we cannot go
higher up northwards than Hmawza, the site of the capital
of the old kingdom of Prome. In fact, I infer that the
kingdom of Lin-Yang may be the same asthe kingdom of
Old Prome that lay, even in those days when the Gulf had
not yet receded so much to the south, much to the interior
at considerable distance from the coast, and could not
be reached by water especially from the region of Chin-
ch’en. The identification with Prome may also find
support in the fact that only two centuries later we have
definite evidence of the prevalence of Buddhism, in the
capital city of this old kingdom where Pali canonical litera-
ture was studied in its doctrinal and most intricate aspects.
But whether the identification of Lin-Yang with Prome
be true or a mere conjecture, we cannot doubt that
this kingdom must be sought for somewhere in Burma,
either in the region of Prome or higher up in the central
districts of the Peninsula,?® where Buddhism was already
in the middle of the third century very well established
with several thousand ‘Sramanas adhering to the Faith’ and
the whole people subscribed to the worship of the Buddha.

If all this is correct, and it seems that it is, then there can
be no doubt that this is the first and earliest definite refer-
: ence to Buddhism in Burma.*°

The Asoka-mission of Sona and Uttara:
Legend and History.
C. 250 B.C.

There is hardly any tradition so universal in the Buddhist
church of Burma and so often repeated in her chronicles as
the story of the first introduction of the Religion of Gautama
the Buddha, by Sona and Uttara, two theras sent by
Moggaliputta mahathera, the teacher of Asoka to evange-
lise the land. The tradition rests primarily on the authority
of the two Ceylonese chronicles, the Dipavamsa*®’ and the
Mahavamsa.** In both the chronicles the story is the same;
and it will be convenient to quote here the relevant portion }
from the Mahdvamsa, which, by the way, gives us a more
detailed version of the narrative (Chap. XII, the Converting
of different countries). 3

“When the thera Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the
religion of the Conqueror, had brought the (third) Council
to an end and when looking into the future, he had beheld
the founding of the Religion in adjacent countries, (then)
in the month Kattika he sent forth theras, one here and

this time the prevalent form of religion. “The kingdom of Tun-hsiin
depends on Fii-nan... In this country there are 500 families of Hu of
India, two Fo-t’'u, and more than a thousand Brahmanas of India.
The (people of) Tun-hsiin practise their doctrine and give them their
daughters in marriage, so many (of these Brahmins) do not depart. | :
They do nothing but read the holy books of the heavenly spirits
and constantly offer unto them white vases: of perfumes and flowers
without ceasing, day and night” (BEFEO., 1905 pp. 298

one there. The thera Majjhantika he sent to Kaémira and
Gandhara ; the thera Mahadeva he sent to Mahisamandala.
To Vanvasa, he sent the thera Rakkhita; and to Aparantaka
the Yona named Dhammarakkhita; to Maharattha (he sent)
the thera Mahadhammarakkhita ; but the thera Maharak-
khita he sent into the country of the Yona. He sent the
thera Majjhima to the Himalayan country, and to Suvanna-
bhimi he sent the theras Sona and Uttara. The great thera
Mahinda, the theras Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhadda-
sila, his disciples, these theras he sent forth with the charge
“Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka, the lovely
Religion of the Conqueror.” ’’?”

The account goes on into details regarding each of the
missions. With regard to Suvannabhiimi it is laid down:

“Together with the thera Uttara, the thera Sona of
wondrous might went to Suvannabhiimi...... Many were the
people who came unto the (three) refuges and the precepts
of duty; sixty thousand were converted to the true faith.
Three thousand five hundred sons of noble families received
it likewise. Thenceforth when a prince was born in the
royal palace, the kings gave to such the name Sonathera.**

With these traditional accounts preserved in the name
and to the credit of religious teachers, one may also read
the accounts of missionary activities recorded by Asoka
himself to his own credit. Besides organising a prosely-
tising band of zealous missionaries to carry the message of
the Master to every nook and corner of Jambudipa, he is
said to have sent missionaries to Tambapanni (Ceylon),
as well as to all his neighbours as far as six hundred
leagues, where the king of the Greeks named Antiochus
lives, and beyond that Antiochus (where live) the four
kings named severally (Turamaya) Ptolemy, (Amtekina)
Antigonos, (Maga or eke! Magas, and (Alikasudara)
Alexander......"

The historicity of the mission to the Greek countries”®
and Ceylon®® has hardly been doubted, recorded as they
are by Asoka himself in his Edicts (RE. V and Alli).
The story of the missions to the Himalayan countries and
Kaégmira is also generally believed.*’ Gandhara, Mahisa-
mandala, Vanavasa, Aparanta and Maharattha were all
within Asoka’s dominions, and Asoka himself claims, in
his edicts, to have left no place in Jambudipa out of his
missionary campaigns and activities. These direct and in-
direct corroborations from independent sources of practi-
cally all the missions referred to in the Ceylonese chronicles
naturally warrants the presumption that the story of the
one mission not upheld by any independent evidence, i.e.,
the one to Suvannabhiimi, is also true in its main outlines.
It is admitted that the account of the Ceylonese chronicles,
as historical evidence, may not commend itself wholly to
scholars, but there is also nothing absurd in the story of
Moggaliputta Tissa’s mission to Suvannabhiimi headed by
two chief theras, Sona and Uttara.

But Vincent Smith dismissed the tradition as ‘mythical’,
and Kern ‘felt grave suspicions” concerning its authenti-
city." Kern wrote in 1896, and Smith within a decade of
that date; much light has since been thrown by historical
and archeeological researches on the interesting problem of
early Indo-Burmese historical and cultural relations. But

35. Rhys Davids doubted the authenticity of Asoka’s missions

no longer seriously held.

of the general historicity of all the missions referred to in the

though nothing has been found definitely to establish the
historicity of the mission itself, the force of the opposition
seems to have subsided to a considerable extent.

Kern’s objections are easily met. He suspects the
duumvirate Sona-Uttara, and thinks that the chroniclers
confused the thera Sonottara or simply Uttara of Duttha-
gimani's time with the theras alleged to have been sent by
Moggaliputta. But one fails to understand why the chroni-
clers should confuse any one of the two theras or both with
the thera Sonottara or Uttara living in the time of Duttha-
gamani (101-77 3. c.). Sona and Uttara of Asoka’s time
were removed by at least a century anda half from Sono-
ttara or Uttara of Dutthagamani’s time; and there is hardly
any evidence in the Ceylonese chronicles of such a curious
confusion. As to the later name Sonottara or Uttara, it is
not unusual to adopt names of earlier theras, sometimes
of single individuals, sometimes of two jointly. Kern
further argues that the duumvirate Sona and Uttara are un-
known to northern Buddhists. This argument is at best an
example of argumentum ex silentio. Maijjhima, Kassapa
and Majjhantika and their missions are also equally un-
known to northern Buddhists, nor are they mentioned in
any of the edicts of Asoka; but there is no more room for
doubting their authenticity.

Vincent Smith’s objections are more substantial, Much
of his statements and arguments would not have, it is cer-
tain, been repeated to-day had he lived to tackle the prob-
lem now after a lapse of more than a quarter of a century,
What remains to-day of his long discourse may be summar-
ised in two arguments; (a) Rock Edicts Nos. V and XIII
give a list of the countries to which he sent mission-
aries to propagate the religion, but there is absolutely no
mention in this list of the mission to Suvannabhimi. ‘“The
silence of the edicts concerning the alleged fact goes a long
way towards disproving its reality, for Asoka seems to have
intended to give a complete account of his missionary oper-
ations, and if he had really sent emissaries to Suvannabhimi

118 NIHAR-RANJAN RAY

previous to the publication of the Rock Edicts, it is incon-
ceivable that he should have omitted to mention in them
an event of such importance...’” Elsewhere he states,
‘Facts vouched for by the inscriptions of Asoka may, there-
fore, be accepted without question, because the testimony
is good on the face of it, and no better can be looked for.
When the evidence of the inscriptions differs from that of
later literary traditions, the epigraphic authority should be
preferred without hesitation”. (b) There is no mention of
the mission of Sona and Uttara also in the Kalyani inscrip-
tions (1476 A.D.) which give a summary of the history of the
introduction and progress of Theravada Buddhism in Burma.
Of the two arguments the first one still holds good, but the
second is practically of no force to-day. For, it has recent-
ly been pointed out by Dr. Blagden, the learned editor of
the Kalyani inscriptions, that a reference to the mission of
Sona and Uttara does occur in the celebrated records. We
shall, therefore, meet the second argument first, though
it is less material in view of the fact that the story of the
history of the introduction and progress of Buddhism in
Burma as recorded in the Kalyani inscriptions is not original
and independent, but seems rather to have been brought
from Ceylon by the monks who were sent by king Dhamma-
ceti (1460-91) to the island to reintroduce a canonically
valid monastic succession in Lower Burma where the Order
had long been splitup into schismatical sects. Moreover,
the evidence of the Kalyani inscription, in respect of its his-
torical value, is no better than that of the Ceylonese chroni-
cles; it is also about nine centuries later in date. The crux
of the question rests finally, therefore, on the value of the
Ceylonese chronicles themselves.

lt is to the credit of king Dhammaceti of Pegu that the
present Buddhist Church and organisation of Pane stands
as it is to-day.

This reformer-king caused a long detailed history of
Buddhism in Burma to. be recorded i in the celebrated Kalyani
inscriptions (1476_ A.D.) of Pegu.. The story is prefaced

Ber se

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 119

by a good deal of historical matter relating to earlier periods
in the long history of Buddhism and particularly to its vicis-
situdes in Ceylon and introduction and development in

Burma.*?

These interesting details are introduced by a
statement regarding Asoka’s reformation of the Buddhist
Church and the mission of Sona and Uttara to Suvanna-
bhiimi.

*‘At the conclusion of this Council (the Third
Buddhist Council convened by Asoka) Moggaliputtatissa
mahadthera reflected that in the future the Religion
would be established in neighbouring foreign countries
and sent such theras as Majjhantika thera with the
injunction; ‘Do you establish the religion in those neigh-
bouring foreign countries?’’ Of these theras, he sent out
lord Mahinda thera to establish the religion in the island
of Tambapanni, and Sona thera and Uttara thera to
establish the religion in the Mén country which was also
called Suvannabhiimi’’.*°
Here is then a definite mention of the Asoka-mission |

otherwise than in Ceylonese chronicles. Prof. Blagden
would have us, therefore, believe that statement of the
Kalyani inscriptions to be not ‘altogether devoid of any
foundation’. ‘Sona and Uttara’’, he says, ‘“‘have long been
claimed by Burma as founders of their branch of the Church;
and though the tale has been embellished with many legen-
dary accretions in the course of ages, it can hardly on that
account be dismissed. Evidence is gradually accumulating
from various different quarters which tends to show that
Indian influence made itself felt in Indo-China from about

go. Ep, Birm., Vol. Ul, Part Il, p. 185 Text A, lines 3-6. The
identification of Suvannabhiimi with the Mén country rests on this
passage. Blagden adds a note and states, “So far as can be con-
jectured from the fragmentary remains of the Mén text, it probably
expresses itsclf in this way—In Suvannabhimi which is the Mén
country. vr

the beginning of the Christian era, or possibly even two or
three centuries before that date; and there seems to be no-
thing antecedently improbable in the story of a Buddhist
mission being sent there at a relatively earlier period, though
it may well be hazardous to fix that date exactly’’.

We now turn to the first argument of Smith. That
argument is convincing so far as it goes, but it does not. go
very far. There is no gainsaying the fact that when ‘the
evidence of the inscriptions (of Asoka) differs from that of
later literary traditions, the epigraphic authority should be
preferred without hesitation’. We, therefore, must accept
first of all and without reserve the testimony of Asoka’s
Rock Edicts V and XIII with regard to the list of countries
where missionaries were sent. But we may proceed also
one step further, for, we have already seen that the tradi-
tion with regard to at least two of the countries, namely,
Kaémira and the Himalayan countries to which, according to
the Ceylonese chronicles, Asoka is said to have sent
missions, are not mentioned in the list as supplied by the
Edicts, but is nevertheless upheld by other independent
sources. The evidence of the chronicles has, therefore,
some claim to be considered at least as supplementing that
of the Edicts. The other side of the argument involves a
well-known logical fallacy, that of argumentum ex
silentio. No one can possibly maintain that there is any
cogency in such an argument. The hollowness of it can at
once be pointed out. That ‘the silence of the Edicts con-

cerning the alleged fact’ does not go very far towards dis-

proving the reality of any of the missions referred to in the
Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa is established by the historicity
of the missions to Kagmira and the Himalayan countries no

reference to which is made in the records of Asoka. The

omission, therefore, of the mission of Sona and Uttara in
the records of Asoka does not prove or disprove the auth-

enticity of the Ceylonese tradition.

_ Tf an attempt has been made above to meet the argu-
ments of Kern and Smith, it is not intended to assert that the

Hee SR ARS
ag

EARLY TRACES OF BUDDHISM IN BURMA 121

Ceyolnese story of the mission to Suvannabhiimi is absolutely
certain, or to say that it is definitely established. All that is
suggested is that once the general historicity of the story of
the missions listed in the Ceylonese chronicles is accepted,
and we have seen that there is hardly any difficulty in accept-
ing it, the presumption will always bein favour of the
Sona-Uttara tradition.*!

IX

Conclusions

Now to conclude: We have in the foregoing pages
traversed a wide expanse of time covering a period of over
twelve hundred years in our attempt to find out traces of
Buddhism, mainly of the orthodox or Theravada School,
in Burma before Anawrahta’s conquest of Thaton and the
consequent introduction of Theravada Buddhism in Pagan
in about the middle of the eleventh century of the Christian
era. We began naturally with the state of Buddhism in

41. “The scepticism with which modern scholars have received it
is perhaps unmerited, but the preaching of these missionaries, if it
ever took place, cannot at present be connected with other historical
events. Nevertheless, the statement of the Dipavamsa (and also of
the Mahavamsa) is significant. The work was composed in the fourth
century A.D. and taken from older chronicles. It may, therefore, be
concluded that in the early centuries of our era, Burma bad the te-
putation of being a Buddhist country.” Eliot, Hinduism and
Buddhism, MI, pp. 50-51. M. Louis Finot, who is, however, gravely
suspicious of the Buddhaghosa tradition, also thinks that the historicity
of the Agoka mission has been contested without much convincing
reason, /4., XX, 1912, pp. 121 ff. In this connection, Taranatha’s
testimony also, I think, deserves consideration, | According
to him Hinayinism in the Koki land (which, he states,
included Pukham=Pagan, and Hamsivati=Pegu) was preached from
the days of Agoka onwards, but Mahiyinism was not known until
the disciples of Vasubandhu introduced it,

Thaton when Anawrahta made a conquest of the country
and tracing backwards ended with the tradition of the
Asoka-mission of Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhiimi. Not
all the traces of footprints of the march of the Religion
through all these centuries are, itis true, equally distinct
and pronounced; some of them are absolutely definite and
may be treated as authentic history; some are less certain
resting as they do on certain assumptions not yet definitely
proved, but accepted none the less by all serious scholars
as working hypotheses; some even are based merely on
traditions which fall far short of history, but critically
considered they have strong claims to be recognised as
containing germs of sober and authentic history that lie
enmeshed in the thick web of mythical and legendary
details. Somehow, we are thus able to present at least
some unconnected facts in the early history of the most
important school of Buddhism in Burma; and these facts
may be summarised as follows:

(1) Asoka sends a mission headed by Sona and Uttara
to evangelise the land of Suvnnabhiimi (C. 250 B.C.) This
tradition has some claims to be considered as a fact of
history.

(2) Chinese travellers see Buddhism, a flourishing reli-
gion at Lin-Yang, identical with Prome or some region in
Central Burma (C, 250 A.D.). This point rests on the identi-
fication of Chin-Lin with Chin-ch’en which, however, is
accepted by all scholars.

(3) Buddhaghosa infuses new life into the religion of
the Master in Lower Burma (C. 400-450 A.D.). The charac-
ter of the tradition is suspicious, but circumstantial evidence
lends a colour of probability to it.

(4) Pali-as the language. of Theravada Buddhism is
known and understood, and Pali canonical texts are
studied and discussed’ in their doctrinal and most
abstruse aspects (C. 400-450 A.D.) in at least the capital
city of the old kingdom of Prome. This point is absolutely
certain. ae a
a

resent

(5) I-Ching testifies to the prevalence of Buddhism in
Sriksetra (Old Prome) and Lang-chia-shu or Lankasu (Tennas-
serim) (C. 675-700 A.D.). This point is absolutely certain;
the identification of Lankdsu with Tennasserim is, how-
ever, tentative.

(6) T'ang Chronicles refer to Buddhism as the religion
of the people in the capital of the kingdom of P’iao (=Pyu),
identical with Old Prome (C. 750-650 A.D.). This is as good
as sober history.

(7) Sculptures, bronzes, terracotta votive tablets, epi-
graphic documents, and monuments of the ruined capital of
Old Prome point to a very flourishing condition of the reli-
gion in that kingdom (C. 550-950). This is definite.

(8) Burmese Chronicles refer to the prevalence of
Buddhism in Pegu where it sometimes came into conflict
with Brahmanical Hinduism (C. 1000-1050). This tradition
certainly contains germs of sober and authentic history.

And lastly,

(9) The story of Anawrahta’s conquest of Thaton
points to a very flourishing state of the religion in the
Talaing kingdom towards the middle of the eleventh
century (1/057 A.D.).

The Copper-plate of Barabudur, 828 Saka,

By Himansu BHUSAN SARKAR

This copper-plate was dug out from the neighbourhood
of Barabudur. Through the intermediary of Mr. Leydie
Melville, Dr. Bosch received this plate for inspection and
he has offered us a transcription of the same.’ The date
of the inscription was variously read as 828 and 848, but
the former date appears now to be generally accepted.”

The inscription records a difference of opinion between
the rdmantas of Palépangan and the nayaka, viz., bhagawanta
Jyotisa, regarding some sawah-fields. It was maintained
by the latter that these fields measured lamwit 4 and for
each tampah the rdmantas were charged to pay silver 6
dharana. Whenthe rdmantas made representation to the
takryan mapatih i Hino viz. Pu Daksottama bahubajra-
pratipaksaksaya, a re-measurement took place and it was
found that the fields measured much less. For each tampah
of these re-measured lands, the rdmantas were charged to
pay silver 6 dharana.

This explanation of the inscription differs however from
that of Dr. Bosch who remarked in the Oudheidkundige
Verslag for 1917 that the inscription records a difference
of opinion regarding some principles of Astronomy. |
consider this interpretation of the text to be doubtful,
because Jyotisa is a proper name with the honourable
title of bhagawanta. ‘This title also occurs in other
inscriptions, e. g., in the Sukabhumi inscription of 784 A.D.,
OJO nos. XCVII, XCIX, etc. Besides, the contents of other

portions of this pecHEGen) run counter to the view of Dr.

Bosch.

If my interpretation of the text is correct, it would
appear that there were either different standards of
measuring lands in different parts of Java (as in medieval
Bengal) or there were abuses in land-measurements. As
the rdmas of Palépangan did not agree with sang nayaka
bhagawanta Jyotiga about the measurement of their sawah-
fields, itseems that the bhagawanta could also be connec-
ted with land-measurements, and were not simply
spiritual personages, as seems to be suggested by Prof.
Krom in Geschiednis p. 161 in his remark on the
bhagawantas of Culanggi. It also appears that the
institution of the bhagawantas was not exclusively confined
tothe region of Dieng. Itis also noteworthy that in the
dispute between the raémas and the ndyaka-bhagawanta,
the appeal directly lay to the rakraydn mapatih i hino,
who was at this time Daksottama bahubajrapratipaksa-
ksaya. There were also different names for denoting
lands of various sizes, such as blah, suku, tampah,
lamwit, etc. The tampah haji appears to be the royal
standard of measuring lands; the inscription itself says
that | tampah haji=100 dpa sihwax 30 dpa sihwa. Reference
has also been made to lands devoted to the service of
deities. Itis probably the same deities to whom tributes
were brought for worship in the month of Magha. It is
instructive to recall in this connection that the inscription
refers at least to one vihdra, that of Pahai, in 1. 12.

MISCELLANY
Recent Researches on Indo-European Fauna
By Dr. BaTaKRISHNA GHOSH

To give an idea of Nehring’s recent researches on Indo-
European culture and original home,’ it will be best
perhaps to give an account of his treatment of Indo-
European fauna. é

Ridgeway and Antonius are of opinion that Bos taurus
brachyceros or longifrons was the type known to the early
Indo-Europeans. Much onthe other hand held the view
that those types were at home with the early Iberian popu-
lation of southern Europe, and that the Indo-Europeans
knew only the Primigenius type. Differing from Schrader,
Nehring holds this latter theory to be more accurate. The
occurrence of the brachyceros-type in early and middle
neolithic period in Switzerland suggests that it was known
to the pre-Indo-European peoples of this region. The
Podolic cow of the same type actually occurs in Hungary.
Antonius believes that the northern Balkan States were the
real home region of the Primigenius cow. An East-European
original home of the Indo-Europeans would thus have the
support of zoology and prehistoric archaeology so far as
the Indo-European domestic animal, cow, is concerned.

Zoologists, however, are not unanimous as to the origin-
al region of domestication of the Primigenius cow.
Antonius and Hilzheimer take it to have been the
Mediterranean region and-Further Asia, whereas Duerst
suggests Anau and Menghin the whole of Trans-Caspiana
and Western Turkestan. If, then, the Primigenius cow was

they could have got it from further Asia and the Mediterra-
nean region as well as from western Inner-Asia. But the
study of the languages may help us to attain greater preci-
sion.

Indo-European words for “‘cow’’, etc., may be divided
into three groups :—

1. Skt. gauh, Av. gaus, Gr. Boiis, Nm: Koo, Lat. bos,
Old frish 66, Old High German kou, Lettish gtioos, etc.

2. Skt. uksan, Av. uxfan, Cymr. Ych, Goth. auhsa,
eke,

3. Gr. fatros, Lat. taurus, Old High German stiur, etc.

The first group is clearly derived from the I.-E. base

*g"5u-—which Ipsen (IF. 41, 175f.) has declared to bea

loan-word from Sumerian gu (<gud) bull’. This will
naturally suggest that the Indo-European cattle-breeding
was derived from the Mediterranean region. Ipsen’s other

suggestion regarding agricultural myths of further Asia and’

their connection with Indo-European culture are indeed
not convincing. But his suggested derivation of [.-E. *g"6u
from Sum. gu(d) is impeccable. In this connection there
arises an interesting problem of prehistoric chronology. It
is now admitted on all hands that the I.-E. base *reudhos
‘red, copper’’ (whence Skt. loha, Gr. eruthrés, Lat. rubber,
Old Ch. Sl. ruda “‘Metal’’, etc.) is ultimately derived from
Sum. urud “‘copper’’. But this metal name must have been
taken by the Indo-Europeans from the Sumerians when
the word urud had not yet lost its final consonant, whereas
the original Sumerian word gud ‘“‘cow’’ had already be-
come gu when the Indo-European borrowed it from them.

- The word for “‘cow’’, therefore, must have been borrowed

long after that for “‘copper’” from the same people. The
final d however began to be dropped in Sumerian in the
first half of the third ‘millennium B.C. It is permissible to
conclude therefore that the domestic animal cow became
known to the Indo-Europeans only after this period. This
however leads to a chronological impossibility, for every-
thing else seems to suggest, thet ae disper of the nda:

pore ene

European tribes had begun before this period—in which
case this loan-word from Sumerian in this form should not
have been known to all the chief Indo-European tribes.
Moreover, [.-E. g"6us is shared by the Indo-lranians to
whom I.-E. agricultural terms are otherwise unknown. At
any rate it shows however that catile-breeding must have
been older than agriculture among the Indo-Europeans,
and therefore could not have come to them along with the
Mediterranean plough-culture.

The derivation of I.-E. *g*éus from Sumerian has there-
fore to be regarded as a linguistic possibility devoid of
material and historical basis. But this linguistic possibility
deserves to be examined more closely. According to Ipsen
Sum. gu(d) is derived from still older mu(d), which in its
turn very probably goes back to ngu(d). This, however, is
the Chinese word for ‘‘cow’’ (ngii) which seems to have
had a final dental originally. Ipsen and Conrady derive
this Chinese word from Sumerian, butis that right? It is
fully established on the evidence of Sumerian sculpture that
they used to practise the vicious custom of blowing into the
vagina of cows for getting more milk. According to
Herodotos, the Scythians used to apply bellows into the
vulva of their mares for the same purpose. It is one of
those customs which the Scythians had brought with them
from the Asiatic steppes where it was known from very
ancient times. Now that the same custom was prevalent
also among the Sumerians, does it not suggest that they
had brought with them cattle-breeding from Inner-Asia,
particularly as the Inner-Asiatic origin of the Sumerians is
quite probable? Some scholars have suggested on inde-
pendent gsounds that originally the Sumerians were the
neighbours of the Chinese in Inner-Asia. (Williams, Ame-
rican Journal of Philology, I, 2078.) It has moreover to be
remembered that Sumerian hasa number of phonological
peculiarities in common not. only with Chinese, but also’
with Tibeto-Burman dialects. The J[.-E. base under

discussion may indeed. be. concealed in Tibetan glang,

134 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

go-lang meaning ‘‘buil’’. Yet phonologically itis difficult
to defend the thesis that Sumerian gu(d) was identical with
Chinese nga. We should rather think here of a common
third source, particularly as the proto-Chinese Hoangho-
cultures know only pig and dog but not the cow which was
introduced into this region at a later date and passed on to
Japan via China. Under the circumstances, one is compelled
to think of the Inner-Asiatic cattle-breeding cultures as the
original source. On the other hand, Ural-Altaic and
Tibeto-Burman seem to be connected with Sumerian
through a common linguistic stratum. Particularly in this
connection we have to note that Altaic too, like Sumerian,
knows the mutations g> wandng=>=m. In some Altaic
dialects this ng is directly written as g asin Sumerian. All
this taken together seems to suggest that Sumerian ngu(d)
finds its linguistic relations among the Inner-Asiatic
languages. Chinese ngu apparently was not borrowed
from Sumerian, but was transmitted to the Chinese from
Western Asia along with the cattle-breeding culture. By
comparing this far-flung group of words with corresponding
ones in the Altaic dialects Nehring finally comes to the
conclusion that the Sumerian and the Ghinese word for
““cow’’ is probably derived from the Altaic or neighbouring
region. The apparent discrepancy between Altaic kuos
and Sumero-Chinese ngu(d) is explained by the phonetic
law obtaining in Altaic according to which a final dental
regularly becomes s.

It has now to be decided whether I.-E. *g"ous was
derived from Sum. ngu(d), as Ipsen suggests, Or was
borrowed from Altaic kuos, as. Oehl holds. That there
are material objections to derivation from Sumerian has
been shown already, On the other hand, the connection
between the I. ~E. form and Altaic kuos is quite possible,
for kuos may after: all be nothing but k"os. The fnal
sibilant of this form might have been felt as the nominative-
ending. The I.-E. stem *g* Su- thus might have been easily

derived Bom Altais; ‘Rage. | ‘Since it is not possible to
meine oR RAT OEE

RECENT RESEARCHES ON INDO-EUROPEAN FAUNA 135

explain the occurrence of this word in so many languages
simply on the theory of borrowing from the original Indo-
European as chronological considerations will not at all
brook such a possibility, we have to assume that the stem
in question was originally at home in the Altaic region
whence it spread eastwards to China and thence to Sumer
on the one hand, and onthe other to the earliest Indo-
Europeans before they began to spread out on Eurasia.
This would suggest that the original home of the Indo-
Luropeans was somewhere near the Ural-Altaic region.

In dealing with the horse too Nehring attacks the prob-
lem at first from the view-point of prehistoric archzeology
and zoology and comes to the conclusion in this respect that
the Indo-European horse-culture could have been derived
only from the Altaic, but not from the Uralic culture. But
the Altaics could not have been the immediate source.
Why? Because the use of the horse in the two cultures
seems to have been fundamentally different. The Altaics
used the horse for food, but the earliest Indo-Europeans—as
Nehring argues differing from Schrader—used the horse prin-
cipally for drawing the chariot. The horse was of course
also eaten by them, but that only in course of sacrificial
orgies. This explains the rarity of horse finds at the site of
the Tripolje-culture which is considered to be the oldest
traceable home, if not the original home, of the Indo-
Europeans, for it is quite obvious that only the princelings
could afford the luxury of chariots to draw which the horses
were necessary. Nehring further develops the idea that the
horse among the Altaics was used to draw four-wheeled
carriages, but the Indo-Europeans struck an innovation
by harnessing them to two-wheeled chariots.

These considerations should help us now to clear up the
tangle around the I.-E. stem *ek"os: Skt. agva — which
notoriously fails to satisfy the demands of the cognate stems
in other I.-E. languages. First of all ‘it has to be borne
in mind that as an O-stem the I.-E.. ek"os must have been
a very late acquisition’ to the original idiom. The spiritus

136 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

asper in the Greek form is a stumbling block, but it has to be
noted that in compounds like ‘Alkippos’ it is missing. The
sp. asp. may however be the outcome of an original i.
Moreover, how to explain thei in the first syllable of the
Greek form? It has to be admitted that Skt. agva and
hippos are phonologically irreconcilable, and yet they are
similar enough, both in form and meaning, to suggest a
common origin—which, under the circumstances, could have
been some non-Indo-European language: the various J.-E.
tribes, evidently, could not reproduce this loan-word in the
same way in their different dialects. After a strenuous search
for the possible source of this loan-word Nehring at last
comes to the conclusion that Turkish okki meaning “‘pair™’
may furnish the clue. The word for ‘‘pair'’ has in various
languages actually come to signify ‘“‘horse’’. Here again we
find that the L.-E. word for “‘horse’’ too was very probably
derive from an Altaic language.

As for the goat, prehistoric archeology and zoology
seem to suggest that various species of this animal were
known to the different Indo-European tribes. This is reflect-
ed also inthe I.-E. dialects, for there we find no less than
nine distinct stems for goat: (1) *aig-, (2) *ago-, (3) *bhugo-,
(4) *qago-, (5) *kapro-, (6) *gabhro-, (7) *ghaido-, (8)
*digha-, (9) *qato-. Now all of them are o or a stems,—~
which shows that the words in question were of the latest
stratum of Indo-European vocabulary. Moreover, the first
three stems belong almost exclusively to the eastern dialects,
and the rest almost exclusively to the west. Six of these
nine stems are represented in Germanic. These isoglosses

clearly suggest that the original home of the tribes concern-

ed should have stretched from the steppes in the east to the
hilly tracts in the west. The flat South Russia could not
have been the original breeding-ground of the goat which
is most at home in the hills: This explains the preponder-
ance of the hilly west in the ].-E. designations for goat-

The consideration of the pig is of peculiar importance in

an enquiry about Indo-European fauna, for the pig is’ not

RECENT RESEARCHES ON INDO-EUROPEAN FAUNA _ 137

an animal which can be marched from one country to
another over long distances. Nomadic tribes, the Turco-
Tartars, for instance, have no pigs. Only comparatively
settled peoples could have bred pigs. Two distinct stems
were used by the Indo-Europeans to designate this animal :
(1) sii-s, (Gr. sts, Lat. siis, etc.); Skt. sikara is to be divided
into uk-ara, for a stem extended by a guttural can be
actually found in other J.-E. languages, e.g. O. Irish socc,
Gr. sika, etc. (2) *porko- (Lat. porcus, Lith. parszas, O. Ch.
Sl. prase, etc.). There are some stems which did not enjoy
such wide popularity, e.g. Lat, sper: O.H.G. ebur; Gr.
choiros : Alb. der, etc. The first thing to note about them
is that they are o-stems and therefore must be later than
*si. *sig-. It has been suggested that the wild boar was
designated by the stem “*siig-, while *porkos signified the
tame household pig which the Indo-Europeans learnt to
breed at alater time when they gradually went over to
agriculture. Indeed, agricultural terms are directly derived
from the word for pig, for English furrow, for instance,
is connected with Lat. porca- In Old Irish socc means
‘‘plough’’. It is clear therefore that the pig-breeding
Indo-Europeans must have been agriculturists—at least
partially. But that is not-all. Nehring further shows that
the J.-E. stem *sd (k)-. for wild boar was very probably
borrowed from the Finno-Ugrian dialects.
To sum up:

(1} In the case of some of the animals, it would be
improbable or quite impossible to localise their breeding in
Northern Europe. :

(2) There is nothing however against localising them in
South-East Europe. .

(3) In most cases the origin of se animal concerned or
breeding of the same must be referred to Asia.

(4) Striking similarities with the designations of the
animals in Asiatic languages could not have been fortuitous.
Indo-European cattle-breeding must have been largely
determined by Asiatic influences.

Recent advances in Kambuja studies
By Dr. B. R. CHATTERJEE

Southern and Eastern India seem to have been in close
touch from very remote times with Indo-China and the
Malay Archipelago. Professor Sylvain Lévi has given ample
evidence from linguistic and cultural data of intimate rela-
tions in prehistoric times between the peoples inhabiting
the western and eastern coasts of the Bay of Bengal. His
conclusions may be summed up in his own words :—‘‘Adven-
turers, merchants and missionaries (in later times) followed,
under better conditions of comfort and efficiency, the way
traced from time immemorial by the mariners of another
race (Mon-Khmér), whom Aryan India despised as savages.”
Recent ethnological researches confirm this theory.

We shall confine ourselves in this short sketch to the
spread of Indian cultural influences in Cambodia during the
period for which we have recorded history. What was at
first only commercial intercourse (between India and Indo-
China and the Malay Archipelago) was followed about the
first century A. D. by political influence. As Winstedt

_writes:( JRAS, Malay Branch, March, 1935). ‘“‘The old
Indian trade in beads of semi-precious stones antedated by
centuries the coming of the Hindus at the beginning of the

» Christian era..... The arrival of Hindus in the Malay world

was neither sudden, violent nor overwhelming. A ship or
so came with the monsoon to exchange beads for gold, tin,
camphor, etc..... Here and there a Passenger won regard as

a warrior or worker in magic. Some married local brides.

Priests came with the Sanskrit lore. The coming of the

Hindu might have been very similar to the later arrival of

the Muslim from India and Arabia.” :
Information from Chinese sources, supplemented by a

Campa (Annam) j inscription, point, to a Kaundinya as the

founder of the first i important Hinduised State in Indo-China
known to us by the : name et Fivnan (the Chinese version of

RECENT ADVANCES IN KAMBUJA STUDIES 139

a vernacular name). This probably happened in the first
century A.D. A second Kaundinya also visited Fii-nan via
the Isthmus of Kra and is said to have completely “Indian-
ised’ the country. The Kaundinyas seem to have been very
influential in South India in the second century A.D. A
second century (Mysore) inscription of a Cutu Satakarni
king and a fourth century inscription of a Kadamba king
record grants of land, in connection with a Siva shrine, to
Brahmanas of the Kaundinya gotra. From the second
inscription it appears that the donee, a Brahmana of the
Kaundinya gotra, was relatedto the donor, the Kadamba
king. The Kaundinyas, who went to Fii-nan, might have
belonged to this aristocratic Brahmana family of South
India—(JBORS, 1933).

The Chinese name Fii-nan represents the old Khmér
word vnam (in modern Khmér Phnom) which means a hill,
(Khmér is the Cambodian vernacular). Gerini proposed to
identify the capital of ancient Fii-nan with the site now
called Ba Phnom (Vrah Vnam in old Khmér). M. Gcedés has
now accepted this identification. The capital of Fii-nan,;
according to Gcedés, was at the foot of the hill Ba Phnom
and it was known as Vyadhapura for centuries in Cambodian
history. Ba Phnom is very near the apex of the delta of the
Mekong. Fii-nan (was Sri Saila the Sanskrit equivalent ?)
developed into a large and powerful state. It came to
include not only modern Cambodia, but also Laos, Cochin
China, Siam and a considerable portion of the Malay
Peninsula. Within this large sphere of influence there were
principalities like that of the Kambujas. (Cambodians)
attached to Fii-nan only by a loose tie of allegiance.

The Chinese chronicles were our only sources of informa-
tion about Fii-nan till M. Coedés deciphered in 1931 two
inscriptions, one Vaisnava. and the other Buddhist in sub-
ject-matter, which may safely be attributed to this -Fii-nan
period of Indo-Chinese history. The first inscription, of a
royal prince Gunavarman, is closely related on account of the
archaic nature of its writing fo certain inscriptions of Borneo,

140 B. R. CHATTERJEE

Campa and Java which have been accepted as belonging to
the fourth or early fifth century A.D. by epigraphists. In fact,
the script is of a much earlier type than that of the inscrip-
tions of Bhavavarman, the earliest hitherto known king in
Cambodia, which belong to the middle of the sixth century.
A.D. Again the second inscription mentions by name two
kings described in Chinese chronicles as the last two monar-
chs of Fii-nan reigning in the first half of the sixth century.
This second inscription on paleographical grounds
seems to belong to a later date (early sixth century) than the
first inscription, which, therefore, should be attributed to
probably the first half of the fifth century A. D,

The introductory lines of the first inscription are illegible.
But in the second half of it we are told that Gunavarman,
son of king (name illegible), had established on this earth
the impress of the feet of Bhagavan. On the eighth day,
this holy object, consecrated by Brahmanas well-versed in
the Vedas, Upavedas, and Vedangas, was proclaimed by
learned sages throughout the world as Cakratirthasvami.
Inthe concluding stanzas it is stated that all that had been
donated to Bhagavan should be at the disposal of all pious
Bhagavatas, and that the mahdima, who would carefully
look after the property of the god, would attain the supreme
bliss of Visnuloka.

This recently deciphered inscription, which probably
belongs to the first half of the fifth century A.D., is the
earliest inscription hitherto discovered in Cambodia.

In 484 a.D., Jayavarman Kaundinya of Fii-nan sent an
envoy tothe Imperial court of China. This envoy, who
was a monk of the name of Sakya Nagasena, told the
Emperor of China that the cult of the god Maheévera
flourished in Fii-nan. The god had his perpetual abode on
Mount Motan where auspicious trees grew in abundance.
This sacred: mountain may now be identified with the hill
called Ba Phnom.

The second of: the. Seublat iheeeions of Fii-nan

a a

Jayavarman. it begins with an invocation tothe Buddha
‘whose compassionate mind is devoted to the good of
others’. Then follows an eulogy of king Rudravarman.
After this we find that king Jayavarman, father of king
Rudravarman, appointed as inspector of royal property the
son of a pious Brahmana. The last portion is illegible. As
Rudravarman is mentioned by Chinese historians as reigning
in 539 A.D., this inscription isto be attributed tothe first
half of the sixth century A.D, Soon after this Fii-nan was
pushed into the background by its vassal State Chen-la
(Chinese name for Kambuja or Cambodia). . This happened
about the middle of the sixth century A.D. From this
period begins a long succession of Sanskrit and Khmér (the
Cambodian vernacular) inscriptions which become our chief
source of information regarding Kambuja or Cambodia.

We have already mentioned that Fii-nan, whose rulers
traced their descent from Kaundinya and resided at
Vyadhapura, counted among their feudatories the rulers of
Kambuja (in Chinese Chen-la) who had made Sresthapura
(Vat Phu) their capital. The Kambuja princes, who traced
their descent from Rsi Kambu, rapidly grew in power, and
the first two princes whose names we know—Srutavarman
and Sresthavarman—made Kambuja independent of Fii-nan.
“They liberated the people from the chains of tribute”’
(Baksei Chamkron inscription). On the death of Rudra-
varman, the last monarch of Fii-nan mentioned in Chinese
annals, there was a dispute as regards. the succession to
the throne. Bhavavarman, who was the ruler of Kambuja
at this time and who was also related to Rudravarman (who
might have been Bhavavarman’s maternal grandfather)
seized this opportunity to conquer part of Fii-nan with the
help of his brother Citrasena known as Mahendravarman
when he ascended the throne afterwards. Fii-nan was not
completely destroyed. The monarchs of Fii-nan retreated to
the region south of their ancient capital Vrah Vnam. But
Fii-nan ceased to be the paramount Power: in Indo-China ag
it had been hitherto,

ve B. R. CHATTERJEE

The conquest of Fii-nan was completed by Iganavarman,
the son and successor of Mahendravarman, who seized the
ancient capital Vrah Vnam. Chinese historians mention

‘éSnavarman as the conqueror of Fii-nan.

Thus fell Fii-nan—probably the earliest of the Indianised
kingdoms in Indo-China. Till very recently all our infor-
mation about it was derived solely from Chinese sources.
Now we know from the two Sanskrit inscriptions deciphered
in 1931 that Vaisnavism as well as Buddhism flourished side
by side with the cult of Siva inthis realm. Indeed, the
earliest sculptures discovered hitherto on Cambodian soil
are Buddhist and belong to the Gupta school of art. They
may be safely assigned to the Fii-nan period.  I-tsing
laments at the end of the 7th century that the law of Buddha,
which had prospered in Fii-nan, had been completely
destroyed by a wicked king—probably a successor of
ISinavarman and a staunch Saiva (the whole dynasty being
fervent worshippers of Siva). The inscriptions of Cambodia
begin with Bhavavarman’s reign. As regards technique,
Kambuja epigraphy shows generally a symmetry and
elegant finish but rarely found in Indian inscriptions and the
literary skill shown in some of them is of a high order.

A new inscription of Iganavarman has been discovered
recently at Sambor. It commemorates the consecration
of aSiva liaga in 549 s.E, (627 A.D.) by the Brahmana
Vidyavigesa—a high official of king [Sanavarman. Vidya-
visesa, the pious founder, according to this inscription,
possessed a sound knowledge of Sanskrit grammar, the
systems of Samkhya, Vaigesika, Nyaya and Buddhism.
It should be noted that Buddhism has been placed here
among the orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy.

To the reign of ISanavarman should also be assigned
the brick temples of Sambor, ‘Hindu shrines consisting in
some cases of groups of buildings, in other cases of isolated,
structures crowned with a -prasat or tower. The orna-
mental work is sober and resembles Gupta art. Indeed,

Kambuja history during the greater part of the eighth
century is a blank. Anarchical conditions prevailed as
the realm was split up among rival powers. In the genea-
logies of later kings, e. g., YaSovarman and Rajendravar-
man as recorded in their inscriptions, we find that the chief
object is to link up these ninth and tenth century monarchs
with all the ancient dynasties which ruled in succession
or simultaneously in the realm which Jayavarman Il suc-
ceeded in unifying. Thus Yagovarman (889-910 A.D.)
and Rajendravarman (944-968 4.D.) claim the heritage of
Vyadhapura (capital of old Fii-nan), Sambhupura (capital,
after Sresthapura, of old Kambuja—the Land Chen-la of
the Chinese) and Aninditapura (the Water Chen-la of the
Chinese). The anarchy of the eighth century was probably
due to the rivalry of these contending states. Wyadhapura
has been identified with Ba Phnom. The inscription of
Vat Cakret in the vicinity of Ba Phnom (which, we have
already seen, was the Khmér equivalent of the Chinese
name of Fii-nan) records a donation by Harsavarman I to
Adrivyadhapurega (Siva of Vyadhapura on the hill), Till
recently Vyadhapura had been identified with Ankor Borei
on the other side of the river Mekong.

Sambhupura is the present Sambor on the Mekong.
The main reason why Yagovarman is anxious to be linked
with the rulers of Sambhupura is that Jayavarman II
belongs to Sambhupura. On his’ return from Javad it was
in the vicinity of Sambhupura that Jayavarman Il first es-
tablished himself.

Aninditapura is to be peach to hes edoti ‘of Angkor on
the north bank of the Great Lake. In Rajendravarman’s
genealogy that monarch traces his descent from Baladitya,
King of Aninditapura, who claimed descent from Kaundinya
—the founder of Fi-nan. Either the last princes of the
ancient realm of Fii-nan shifted from Vyadhapura (after

its capture by Iéanavarman) to Aninditapura, or it was a

144 B. R. CHATTERJEE

branch of the dynasty of Bhavavarman of Kambuja which,
pitting itself against the other branch made Aninditapura
its headquarters. Bhavavarman and his successors, after
their conquest of Fii-nan, also claimed descent from
Kaundinya like the Fii-nan monarchs whom they had over-
thrown. Either this was an attempt to represent themselves
as the legitimate rulers of the realm as they (Bhavavarman
and his successors) might really have been related to the
last monarchs of Fii-nan.

In any case it was Jayavarman If (latter part of the 9th
century to 654A.D.) whoclosed this period of anarchy by
bringing about again the unity of Kambuja. The inscription
of the High Priests of Devaraja (the Royal God) gives us
interesting information about some events of his reign. We
learn from this record that he came from Java (was he an
exile there?) and invited a Brahmana from ‘janapada’ (his
own country Sambhupura?) to draw up a ritual. This Bra-
hmana taught the royal purohita four texts (Vindsika, Nayot-
tara, Sammoha and Siragcheda) and drew up a ritual for the
worship of Deva Raja, the tutelary deity of Kambuja. Some
of these texts have been traced by Dr. P. C. Bagchi in the
Nepal Durbar Library. Sirascheda seems to be identical with
the fayadrathayamala of which a copy exists in Nepal.
Naya- and Uttara siitras (together constituting Nayottara)
form a part of the Nigedstattvasamhita in the Nepal Library.
Vinasika seems to have been a supplement to the
Jayadrathayamala. These Tantras were therefore of North-
Indian origin. In the Brahmaydmala, three of the texts,
Nayottara, Sammoha, and Sirascheda, are referred to as
issuing from the left current (vGmasrota).

What was this ‘Java’ from which place Jayavarman Il
came to reign in Kambuja? Till recently Java was identified
with Zabaj or Srivijaya. This identification was based on
the supposition that the Bayon, originally a Mahayana
temple, was begun in Jayavarman Il’s reign. Now
that we aré sure that the Bayon belongs to a much
later date, we need not stick to the identification

rs

RECENT ADVANCES IN KAMBUJA STUDIES 145

of ‘Java’ with Srivijaya. It is likely that Jayavarman II
came of Java itself where a cult resembling that of the
Devaraja was already fourishing.

Jayavarman II not only introduced Tantric Saivism, he
is also represented in the inscriptions as having built many
capitals one after another. The first capital Indrapura
was near the ancient Sambhupura which seems to have
been Jayavarman’s ancestral home. The other capitals
were near the Great Lake (Tonle Sap) which region from
this time becomes the political centre of Kambuja. Of
these capitals but few traces remain, as being only tempo-
rary residences they were built of perishable material,
The golden age of Khmér architecture had not yet begun.
A group of three brick towers of the 9th century, on the
site of Bantiay Kedei is the first vestige of pre-Angkor art at
Angkor and has now been accepted asa hitherto undis-
covered capital of Jayavarman II. Jayavarman II's reign
came to a close in 854 a. pb. and not in 869 A.D. as hitherto
supposed. The latter date (869) was based on a wrong
rendering of a damaged inscription. That does not mean
that Jayavarman ll had not a long reign. He began his
reign not in 602 A.D., as is generally supposed- In that
year he founded his capital on Mahendra Parvata after
having abandoned three previous capitals.

Netherlands Indias A Stupy or PLuRAL Economy—By J. S.
Furnivall, Cambridge University Press. pp. 502+ xxiv.,
1938

The author of this comprehensive study of the Dutch
East Indies is aretired member of the Indian Civil Service,
who after his period of service in Burma has been carrying
on research studies as Honorary Research Fellow of the
University of Rangoon. His contact with Burma has led him
to the impression that ‘‘much as England has Europe for its
background, so Burma has for its background the tropical
Far East’’ and hence his investigations of the political, social
and economic history and development of that part of the
Far East which has been under Dutch sovereignty for more
than three centuries. Undoubtedly there are close socio-
economic analogies between Burma and India: in fact, the
author begins his study of the Indies by a brief historical
reference to the process of colonisation of the ‘Other India’’
from Continental India.

_ Netherlands India, picturesquely described as ‘‘a girdle of
emerald, flung round the Equator,’’ comprises the whole
Malayan archipelago, except the Philippines and parts of
New Guinea, Borneo and Timor, and covers an area of 7
lakhs of square miles. Controlling, in a manner, the two
gateways into eastern waters—Malacca and Sunda straits—
its strategic importance is of no mean consequence to both
the defence of British Empire in Asia and Australia and
the Dutch Government in Batavia and the Hague. As a
result of recent events Amboyna is being developed, like
Singapore, though on a much smaller scale, as a great
arsenal, its harbour is being reconstructed and the garrison
reinforced. In the world’s economy the crucial position of
the Dutch Indies may be realised from the fact that in 1937
80 per cent. of the world’s export of pepper, 38 per cent. of

REVIEWS 147

the world’s export of rubber, 30 per cent. of the world’s ex-
port of cocoanut palm, came from the Dutch Indies, which
are also well-supplied with petroleum, tin sugar, tea, oil-
seeds, copra and cinchona. Apart from these, the Dutch
Indies offers to the student a rich source of comparative
study in administrative technique, treatment of the ‘native’
people, and above all the social, educational and economic
characteristics of what forms the sub-title of the work—a
plural economy. Mr. Furnivall admirably succeeds in his
task of ‘‘depicting stage by stage throughout the course of
history, the general political and economic environment of
Netherlands India, and at tracing in each stage the course
of economic progress and the main features of social eco-
nomy-”’ To the Indian reader the study is not only informa-
tive but distinctly stimulating, particularly in the subjects of
‘native’ schools and Dutch schools, the methods of local
government, the racial cleavages, the development of
nationalism and communism amongst the sons of the soil,
the undercurrent of the rivalry in the course of the European

attempts at exploitation of the resources of the country, and

last but not least in importance, the arrangements at the
plantations run by the government and private capitalists.
Some of the salient features of Dutch colonial rule are
worth noting, particularly because in recent years Dutch
experiments have been recommended to the notice of India.
Till the dawn of the 19th century, except round Batavia, a
trading company flying the Dutch flag plied their trade. The
story of two centuries of the company’s ‘monopoly of trade
and the final collapse bear resemblances to the British East
India Company’s record in India. Mr. F urnivall in discuss-
ing why the English Company survived and the Dutch fail-
ed, ascribes the cause neither to corruption nor defects in
accounts nor the policy of monopoly, but to (a) the Indus-
trial Revolution in England which created a class in the
‘mother-country’ which wanted ta sell goods to the colony

as well, and (b) the rigid Dutch system of government
which did not allow the right of parliamentary scrutiny
to penetrate the dark spots of the regime of the Dutch
Company. The occasion of the failure of the company was,
of course, furnished by the war with England (1781-84),
followed by years of confusion until in 1815 the Dutch
monarchy took over the colonies. Crown farms with enfor-
ced planting of indigo, sugar, and coffee were established
and taxes were realised in kind. Till 1870 the system
continued with various modifications. In that year the
door was opened to private traders, and capitalists could
hire land from ‘natives’ on lease for planting. The era
of liberalism did not mean, however, any repudiation of
batig slot, the surplus revenue to spend in Europe. The
twentieth century ushered ina new Imperialism; ‘native’
welfare became a definite programme of Government; the
Outer Provinces began to receive a new attention due to
the growing demand for raw materials for Eur-American
industrial development.

The political approach also underwent a vital change.
The traditional structure of Dutch colonial administration
was based on the principle of a plural civil service and
administration for the ‘‘natives’”’ and Europeans. There
were areas which were indirectly ruled through native
rulers in state lands, governed according to native customs.
In 1903 Idenburg’s Decentralization Law set up local
councils of Europeans and natives with advisory powers
and in 1918 the volksraad or representative Parliament for
Central Indian affairs was created. Yet true decentraliza-
tion is yet to come. _The author furnishes one explanation
of the reluctance to transfer the power of taxation and
spending to popular bodies. ‘‘The English tradition in
government is to. maintain law and order, and beyond that
to interfere no further than is necessary; the Dutch, with
their heritage of Roman: law, expect more of government,
and the delegation of authority is therefore more difficult,
just as only a simple organism can, reproduce by fission’’.
REVIEWS 149

It is only in urban areas that successful and real local
government exists and many of the towns are models in
several respects. The reason for the grant of powers to
these municipalities is that they are mostly run by
Europeans for Europeans.

Mr. Furnivall’s treatise bears the appropriate sub-title
‘(A Study in Plural Economy’’. A plural society has been
defined as ‘‘comprising two or more elements or social
orders which live side by side, yet without mingling, in one
political unit’. They are to be found in dependencies
where the rulers and the ruled belong to different races.
The native, European and Chinese elements of the popula-
tion, their economic, educational and administrative pro-
blems, and the sectionalism—all present features, analogies
of which will appear to every Indian reader’s mind. “The
fundamental character of the organization of a plural
society as a whole is indeed the structure of a factory
organized for production, rather than of a state organized
for the good life of its members’’. It should be noted,
however, that industrial capitalism has its own method of
levelling down differences and in recent years the domina-
tion over agricultural and rural interest by urban and
industrial interests is becoming more and more marked.

Placed between the Chinese and the European
enterpriser and trader, it is remarkable that the natives
have been gradually building up their business in spite of
the so-called “non-economic’’ characteristic of the people.
On the other hand, the village-system, as developed under
successive administrations, under the headman and with the
autonomy and_ self-regulation allowed through village
institutions is, to say the least, evidence of Dutch zeal.
Though criticised as ‘artificial’, much of the welfare
instructions of the Netherlands Indian Social Economy may
well be studied for experimentation and adaptation in
British India. Oh Tee)

Though Holland's paternalistic admimistration has a
record no worse than that of other countries, new forces

have been released both within the Dutch East Indies as
well as outside. The depression reduced the annual value
of exports from Netherlands India to even one-fifth of the
1925 level and a rapid progress towards industrialisation is
regarded asthe only alternative to lessen the dependence
on the shifts in world prices of her raw materials. Politically
also Netherlands India has reached a critical stage in her
development. Netherlands India is no longer a source of
profit to the mother country, in fact, Holland is repaying her
“Debt of Honour" to the colony by having taken over the
debts of Netherlands India: still the bureaucracy-ridden
country finds herself with unbalanced and meagre budgets.
The new Constitution of 1927 has been somewhat still-born
and nationalism in the colonies is tinctured by racial as
well as Moslem antipathy. Professor Bousquet of the
University of Algiers published a book from Paris a few
months ago which reveals how nationalist agitation and
political reform in Netherlands India are closely intertwined
with Moslem aspirations. British Indian events have played
agreat partin shaping the nationalist movement in these
islands. The native population, homogeneous in culture
and religion, is free from caste. The women “‘are even
freer than in Buddhist Burma’’. The result has been the
gradual drift towards extremism, all the politically-minded
elements aiming at “‘breaking loose from the Netherlands”.
Holland at last is facing economic and political issues,
which sooner or later has had to be faced by all Imperial
countries. Lord Hailey’s ‘‘African Survey’’ and the British
Colonial Office Report (1938) tell how the British people
have tackled and intend to tackle similar problems.
There can be no doubt that a new technique of
imperialism suitable to a “phase of contracting capitalism’
(to use Professor Laski’s expressive phrase) is gradually
emerging in the colonial. empires of western nations.

Mr. Furnivall’s treatise is. not only a learned and
exhaustive study of a neighbouring colony of another
European country, but is a distinct contribution to. the

knowledge of the student of comparative administration and
economics. Not only inthe past, but even to-day by a
curious irony of circumstances, the problem of Netherlands
india isin more than one respect similar to and compar-
able with analogous developments in British India.
Here is another instance to prove that the study of Greater
India cannot be concerned with the past only, but must
relate to the present and also the future, where closer and
natural politico-economic links are sure to be forged
between India and her neighbours.

Goncepts of Buddhism!—By Dr. Bimala Churn Law,
Ph.D., M.A., B.L. Published by the Kern Institute, Leiden,
1937. |

It is refreshing to go through Dr. B. C. Law’s Concepts o
Buddhism, dealing, as it does in a terse style, with the
principal concepts of Pali Buddhism. Throughout all the
writings of Dr. Law, one cannot but be impressed with the
indefatigable industry bestowed by him on putting together
all the available materials and focussing them on particular
topics. We appreciate his work of this nature which, as it
appears to our mind, is to leave the reader free to form
his own opinion about a particular topic. The present
work is no exception to his usual method and thorough”
ness. The one desideratum. which every modern student
of Buddhism will miss is that Dr. Law confines his
attention wholly to the Pali literature and never turns to
the Buddhist Sanskrit literature, Hinayana or Mahayana,
nor takes notice of the contributions made by dis-
tinguished writers of the present day. His undue reli-
ance on Buddhaghosa has made his interpretations in several
instances traditional, ¢.g. his comments on the word “tathd-
gata’, his exposition of the ‘ariyasaccas’ and the ‘paticca-

Ped

152 REVIEWS

samuppdda’. But we thank him for the amount of energy
devoted by him for bringing together the traditional inter-
pretations of ‘Dhamma’ and ‘Nibbana’. It is unfortunate
that Dr. Law avoids giving any definite opinion about the
controversial issues. It is, however, interesting to note that
the author’ holds that ‘dhamma’ according to Buddha is
‘nibbdna’ while it is ‘swarga’ according to Asoka (p. 76).
In Chapter Il, the author deals with ‘‘Pdramita’’ and remarks
that ‘‘references (to Paramita) are scattered here and there
in the Pali Nikdyas” (p- 9). We are afraid that this remark
is not sufficiently cautious, for “‘pdramita’’ does not occur
either in the Angutta-Nikadya or the Sangiti-suttanta where
these should have found a place in any event, not to speak
of any other Nikaya. The “‘Pdramita’’ doctrine is originally
non- | heravada and it is a later development. He refers to
the only Mahadyanic treatise Sraddhotpdda-sitra the origin-
ality of which is still a matter of controversy and has not a
word about the voluminous Maha&yanic literature on prajfid-

paramitad. We do not quite follow Dr. Law when he says

that the ‘“‘ariyasaccas are regarded as quintessence of
Buddhism’’. The ariyasaccas are universally accepted and
there is nothing particularly Buddhistic in the formulae. All
that it stands for is how to approach a problem and find
out its solution. We do not quite follow him as also does
Prof. Keith (see p. viii) when he says “‘jhdna is the main
point in the Noble Eightfold path’’ instead of samméd-difthi.
In the chapter on Jhdnas, Dr. Law regards ‘‘the five jhdnas
a somewhat later classification which had developed out
of the four jhdnas’’. The classification of jhdnas into four
or five is not of much importance. The first two jhanas
are sometimes expanded into three thus: (i) Savitakka-
savicara, (ii) sa-vitakka-avicara and (iii) avitakka-avicara.
The jhanas have been dealt with by Dr. N. Dutt and Mons.
Lounsbery exhaustively in their writings on Buddhist medi-

tation (Vide I.H.Q. Vol. XI, pp. 710-740 and La Meditation
Bouddhigue, Paris, 1935). The treatment of the jhdnas,
i am afraid, lacks a grasp of the subject on the part of the
author. Scholars have so far failed to agree about the
Buddhist conception of Puggala, so Dr. Law has done well
in presenting the important discussions found in the Pali
texts. Profs. Stcherbatsky and la Vallée Poussin have devot-
ed long discussions to the subject and the author has not a
word to say about their opinions. He gives his own idea
of the Buddhist conception of Puggala which is that there
is no soul andrebirth is ‘“‘the continuity of an impulse’’.
As the author's object is mainly to explain the concepts of
Buddhism, we must say that he has acquitted himself well
of his task and the book will serve as a very useful hand-
book to our students of Pali and Ancient Indian culture.

The Bhadramayakaravyakarana, INTRODUCTION, TIBETAN
TEXT, TRANSLATION AND NOTES—By Konstanty Régamey. The

Warsaw Society of Sciences and Letters. Publications ie:

the Oriental Commission, No. 3.

The Warsaw Society of Sciences and Letters is rendering
a substantial service to the study of ancient Indian culture
by publishing rare Buddhist texts. The present one is the
second one of this series, the first being three chapters from
Samadhirdja siitra. Dr. Régamey points out the importance
of the Ratnakita collection of Mahayanacsiitras and intends
to publish the texts of this collection gradually. This is
undoubtedly a laudable ambition and we. hope the author
will have time, patience and due encouragement and
support to carry out such an arduous task. It is really
unfortunate that the Sanskrit originals of 43 out of 49 texts
of this collection are lest unless some chance discovery like
that of Gilgit MSS. in Kashmir or of Rahula Sankrityayana
in Tibet brings them to light. Dr. Régamey is perhaps not

aware that the Naigai-shuppen-Kaisha (Printing Press),

19

SES

154 REVIEWS

Kyoto, (Japan), has published an edition of the Tibetan text
of Stimaladevi-simhandda-sittra and Ratnacandrapariprecha.
The treatise belongs to the Vyakarana class, as it fore-
tells the future of Bhadra. The Buddhist texts, specially
the Mahayanic, abound in similar anecdotes and parables to
establish that the world around us has no more existence
than the things produced by a magician by magical tricks,
and this idea has been well-expressed from the texts by
Dr. Régamey in these words (p. 7): ‘‘The enjoyments and
gains of all beings are created by the mayd of karman, this
order of monks is created by the maya of dharma;1
(Buddha) am created by the maya of jidna, the trisahasra-
mahdsahasra-lokadhdtu is created by the maya of Vigva-
bhinivrtti and all the dharmas are created by the maya of
pratyayasambhara’’. Incidentally the question of soul is
discussed and the qualities of Bodhisattvas are dilated upon.
The Anguttara-nikdya style of mentioning the qualities of
a Bodhisattva is interesting.
_ The author’s restoration of Sanskrit words from Tibetan
is happy and has added much to the value of the text.
The English language suffers from the defects unavoidable
by a foreigner, e. g. inreality for unreality, ‘allocution for
elocution, inexistent for non-existent, but that can detract
from the value of the book. Dr. Régamey has indeed
accomplished a laudable task and we wish he would
continue his work in this line with unabated zeal.

We notice here the same qualities that have distinguished
his earlier works in that series, an easy and flowing style, a
readiness to utilise the Jabours of the best and most
up-to-date authorities, complete references and a full and
adequate description of topics under well-arranged heads.
Of the two Parts into which the present work is divided,
the first and the smaller portion (Book V) bears the title
‘Culture and Civilisation in Suvarnadvipa’. (Q. Why this
duplication of the same word and why the exclusion of Art
from the purview of culture andits consideration under a
separate heading?). This portion has separate chapters on
‘Law,’ ‘Economic Condition,’ ‘Society,’ ‘Literature’ and
‘Religion’. In the first chapter, Dr. M., after a preliminary
enumeration of the law-books of Java and Bali, gives a
detailed account of one of them (Kutdra-mdnava.édstra},
comparing some of the leading provisions of the Javanese
law with their counterparts in the Sanskrit smrtis. For the
sake of completeness of the comparison, it would have been
better, if Dr. M. had also taken into consideration the
corresponding provisions of the law in Kautilya’s (or »
Kautalya’s) chapter called Dharmasthiyam. On the. subject
of slavery, Dr. M. (p. 17) observes that the four classes of
slaves mentioned inthe Javanese work above mentioned
closely follow Manu. This is hardly accurate, as Manu’s
list extends up to seven classes, including besides the above,
the krita, the dairima, and the paitra. In connection with
this point, Dr. M. observes that the Javanese law as regards
emancipation of slaves is more liberal. If he had referred
to Kautilya’s work, he would | have found that it does allow
(Jolly and Schmidt's edition, p- 107) the self-sold slave, the
born slave; and the pledged slave to purchase freedom.
What is more, it prescribes a fine for neglecting to liberate
the slave after payment of his ransom. Even the
Narada smrti, to which Dr. M. eats lays dows, that a

slave who rescues his master’s life from grave peril is
forthwith delivered from servitude. For the Javanese law
that when a master married a female slave, their children
inherited the property of the father if the latter had no
children by wives of equal birth, Dr. M. could have found
a distant parallel in Yajfiavalkya (II, 134), which says that
a Sidra’s son by a female slave gets a half share of the
inheritance when there are legitimate sons, and a full share
where there are no such sons and no daughter’s sons.

In the chapter on ‘Economic Condition’, Dr. M. gives a
luminous account of the foreign trade of the countries
included in his title ‘Suvarnadvipa’, from Fa-Hien’s time
downwards. If he had utilised the numerous Old-Javanese
inscriptions (of which we understand a Corpus is going to
be published by Mr. H. B. Sarkar of the Dacca University
in a short time), he could have given us almost equally full
descriptions of the agriculture and industries of the
countries concerned. Even the list of exports given in
many of the foreign accounts utilised by him would have
helped him to fill this gap.

In the chapter on Society, after premising that the
Indian caste-system, as described in the Manu-samhita,
prevails in its essential features even to-day among the
Balinese, Dr. M. thinks (p. 44) that the few recorded notices
of ancient Java and neighbouring lands are not inconsistent
with such conditions. Itis difficult to reconcile this state-
ment with Dr. M.'s hesitation (p. 40) to accept the referen-
ces to the caste-system in Java, etc. as anything but a
theoretical division, and still more with his positive conten-
tion (p. 49) that a large section of the people of Java was
still at the last period of Hindu culture outside the pale of
that civilisation. Dr. M.'s. case for the close parallel
between ancient Javanese and modern Balinese societies
would have gained i in weight, if he had given actual ins-
tances from ancient times of such institutions as anuloma

REVIEWS 157

himself to the statements for which it would be well to
have his authorities, that polygamy was prevalent on a
large scale in India, and that widow-remarriage was all but
unknown in that country.

The chapter on Literature under its sub-headings of
Javanese, Balinese, and Malayan, gives usa very useful
and comprehensive survey of the subject which it treats.
It is, however, unfortunate that Dr. M. should have consi-
dered it beyond his scope to enter into a discussion not
only of the qualities of this literature asa whole, but even
of such outstanding works as the Javanese versions of the
Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Javanese historical
works and chronicles and so forth.

The chapter on Religion deals separately with Java,
Bali and other parts of Malaysia, ending with a good
appendix on the religious literature in Java. Dr. M. prefers
to stick to the now generally disused expression
“*Pauranic form of Brahmanical Hinduism,” although it is
a fact that what is called the Pauranic Trinity is referred
to as early as in Maitrayani Upanisad (IV, 5—6; V, 2)
while its more sectarian forms are mentioned even in the
Ramayana (VI, 106, 19) and the Mahabharata (III, 272. 46).
Dr. M.’s treatment of the Javanese types of Brahmanical
deities might have been enriched by comparison with their
Indian prototypes from the point of view of general con-
ceptions as well as iconography. The same remark applies
mutatis mutandis to his description of rituals and mantras
for Siirya and Visnu which he has industriously compiled
from the writings of two Dutch authorities. While on this
subject, Dr. M. justly draws attention to the predominance
of Saivism in Java, but we miss an explanation of a pheno-
menon of such outstanding importance. The description
of Mahayana Buddhism in Java is good so far as it goes,
but we could have expected a fuller treatment of the in-
fluence of Buddhism from Bengal to which he just refers.
The list of Sivite sects culled from texts and inscriptions
could have heen compared with those mentioned in the

Saiva agamas. In particular, the author could have dis-
cussed the probable identity of the Bhairava sect of Java
with the Kapalikas and Kalamukhas of India. Dr. M.
contrasts the later (Tantric) form of Buddhism in Java with
the earlier by saying that TAantrism at its best sought to
attain by supernatural or magical practices in this life such
spiritual bliss as original Buddhism sought to acquire by a
series of rebirths. The distinctive characteristic of
Theravada Buddhism, however, is that it enjoins a progres-
sive course of discipline beginning with sila and passing
through various stages of jhana and paffid to the stage of
the passionless arahat. It is again difficult to accept the
author’s view (p. 123) that the last phase of MahSyana con-
sists of syncretism of different Hindu and Buddhist gods.
The second and larger section of the present work
called ‘Art in Suvarnadvipa’ consists of eleven chapters,
bearing the titles ‘The Architecture of Central Java,’
‘Sculpture of Central Java,’ ‘The Architecture of Eastern
Java,’ ‘Sculpture of Eastern Java,’ ‘Bronze Sculptures,’
‘Art in Bali,” ‘Art in Sumatra,’ ‘Art in Borneo,’ ‘Art in
Malay Peninsula,’ ‘Art in Other Islands,’ and ‘General
Review of the Art of Suvarnadvipa.’ These chapters con-

tain by far the most exhaustive account of the Art of

Malaysia that we have in the English language, and accom-
panied as they are by a series of seventy-five plates selected
with rare judgment, they constitute the most useful portion
of this work. We, however, find it difficult to follow the
author in his contention (p. 346) that the common source
of the architecture and sculpture of these regions is to be
found in the Gupta art. The influence of the Amaravati
school upon certain phases of early ‘Srivijaya’ sculpture to
which pointed attention has been drawn in recent years
(N. J. Krom, Ann. Bibl. of Ind. Arch. 1931, pp. 29-33;
IGIS., Vol. 1, pp. 31 ff; Vol. Ill, pp. 30 ff.) rests on good
grounds. In this connection itis interesting to note that
Dr. M. observes (p. 351) that South India exercised no in-

fluence of any importance upon Malaysian art generally
{
\

™~

REVIEWS 159

till the 10th and Ilth centuries A.D. This completely
ignores the arguments for implying South-Indian influence
on certain Sumatran and Malayan sculptures which have
been advanced in previous numbers of this Journal. (See
IGIS, Vol. 1, pp. 33 £, and Vol. Il, pp. 54 . and the refe-
rences given there). Dr. M. justifies his position by pointing
to the close similarity of Gupta and early Javanese temples
as regards plan, roof and decoration. Notto speak of the
remarkable plans of Candi Sevu and Candi Loro Jongrang
and above all of Borobudur, it would be interesting to ask
for Gupta prototypes of Kalasas in such early temples as
Candi Arjuna and Candi Pavon. While on this subject,
we can not but regret that the author (p. 351) has considered
it beyond his scope to trace in detail the influence of later
phases of Indian art (such as Pala and Cola) upon the art
of Suvarnadvipa. We thus altogether miss a consideration
of the place of the unique Paharpur temple in the evolu-
tion of Malaysian art.

We have noticed a few mis-prints which may be cor-
rected in a later edition :—dhvaja-hrta (p. 17), Raghunandan
(p. 44), manner (p. 47), its (p. 74).

We cannot conclude without congratulating the learned
author on his producing a work which should be indispen-
sable to all English-knowing readers who are interested in
the culture of Greater India.

In 1930 and 193], the S ceotetiiclian adie of the
Archaeological Department of the Dutch East-Indies was
projected on the temple-complex of Prambanan. In the
latter year, the principal candis of the temple-groups of
Gedong Songo were successfully restored. As regards
European antiquities, there was inventarisation and mainten-
ance of the company’s country-houses in Batavia, Bantam,

160 REVIEWS

Banda Archipelago, Manodo, Sumatra and Bali. A very
important discovery in Bali was the casting mould of bronze
kettle-drum. Prehistoric explorations at Sampumg in East-
Java ended this year, but the inventarisation of neolithic
work-shops in the district of Punung in East-Java continued.
An inscription was found at Kandat (Kediri), while two
images with inscriptions were found in the regency of
Tulungagung.

Reconstruction-activity at Prambanan continued through-
out the following year and the Southern main temple was
completely restored in 1932. The most important discovery
of 1932 was the Siva-image, Im in height, found in Kali
Wadas, 6kmto the South-West of Tegal. This is said to
be the biggest of the bronze images so far discovered in
Java. Some Mohammedan monuments in Cheribon were
also restored this year.

In 1933 the reconstruction-activity at Prambanan provi-
sionally ended with the Northern main temple. The most
important find of 1933 is the bronze Buddha image from
desa Sempaga onthe west coast of Celebes. The writer
thinks it to be a “‘product of the Buddhistic Art-school,
which, in the first centuries after Christ, developed at
Amaravati in S$. India, and that it belongs to the oldest
remains from the Hindu period so far discovered in the
Ayrchipelago.”’ Dr. Van Stein Callenfels undertook prehis-
toric explorations in Celebes, which made it possible for
him to further define the Southern boundary of Philippine-
Minahassi culture. In the Dutch Indies proto-neolithicum
is found for the first time in Galumpang. European anti-
quities received scant attention for want of funds.

In 1934 and. 1935, there were minor restoration-activities
at Prambanan. In the former year some inscriptions were
found at Palembang. In 1935 some incised gold plates
were found at desa Sidomulya.. In this year arrangements
were also made to ascertain the ‘‘colonial style’’ in archi-
tecture from 1750-1850.

The present Jubilee number of the Archaeological
Department of Netherlands India is a very opportune
publication and gives usa succinct review of the fruitful
activities of the Department conducted in close co-operation
with the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences. The
Department has done excellent work in the domain of
excavation, conservation, reconstruction, restoration, in
ventarisation, publication, etc. In 1912 appeared the
Oudheidkundige Verslagen which was continued from
1913-"30, 1936, 1937; in the series of reports appeared
Inventaris der Hindoe-oudheden (1914, 1915, 1923). In 1925
a new series commenced with the Publicaties van den
Oudheidkundigen Dienst of which part I has been issued.
Besides, the Hommage, a Journal devoted to prehistorica,
appeared in 1932. Not the least important are the articles
by members of the staff, which have been published in
TBG, BKI, etc. Numerous projects of restoration and

reconstruction were undertaken and carried out between |

1913 and 1938. The following deserve special mention: the
Naga-temple and the Date-temple of Panataran (1917-18),
Candi Sawentar (1921), Plumbangan (1921), Candi Badut
(1926), Candi Ngawen (1926-27), Candi Sewu (1928), Candi
Kalasan (1929), Candi Sari (1930), Candi Singhasari (1937).

Comment and Criticism

New CaTALOGus CATALOGORUM (PROVISIONAL FASCICULUS).

I

In Mr. Shiva Prasad Bhattacharya’s review of the New
Catalogus Catalogorum of the University of Madras,
published in the journal of the Greater India Society, Vol.
VI, No. | of January, 1939, there are some criticisms which
I may be permitted to answer.

i) The reviewer remarks about ‘unnecessary duplication
(e.g. Aksobhyatirtha, etc.) which in several cases are
verbatim reprints from Aufrecht’s work,’ and which, the
reviewer suggests, could ‘easily have been dispensed with.’
I beg to draw the attention of the reviewer to our preface

where our undertaking has been described as a work of

bringing up-to-date Aufrecht’s Catalogus Catalogorum and
not one of merely supplementing it. The advantage of
bringing out an up-to-date revision of Aufrecht’s work is

‘to remove the necessity for the old catalogue.

ii) The alleged mispagination of pages 9-16 is not borne
out by an examination of a number of copies in our office.

iii) We are thankful for the correction, Mm. Gananath
Sen for Mm. Ganganath Sen..

iv) Regarding misprints in general, it is necessary to
point out that the fasciculus issued was provisional in nature
and was got ready in haste last December for distribution
at the All-India Oriental Conference at Trivandrum.

v). The workers are not suffering from any tendency
to overburden the work with entries of works of question-
able value, or of unimportant works of particular provinces.
There is a slight difference of opinion on the question of
entering modern works and it is to elicit the generel opi-
nion of the world of scholars that such entries were intro-
duced. Including the reviewer, only three scholars have
COMMENT AND CRITICISM 163

expressed their view that such works had better be excluded.
No partiality for any particular province was, however;
responsible for the entries of some of the unimportant
works mentioned by the reviewer. On this and the previ-
ous question, it was thought ft to incorporate in our cata-
logue the entries in the British Museum and India Office
Catalogues of Sanskrit Printed Books.

vi). Incorporation of works and authors known through
citations alone is receiving its proper share of attention.

vii). Regarding the spelling of Angirakalpa and Angi-
rApri, which the reviewer would emend into Angirah-
kalpa (>) and Angirah-apri (>) I may be permitted to re-
mark that dictionaries permit the forms—Angiras, Angira
and Angira.

viii). The reviewer’s criticism of Akalabhaskara seems
unnecessary, since the expression, intercalary months, as
used in Sanskrit-English Dictionaries and by modern
writers in English on Smrti, is sufficiently expressive of
periods unfit for rites.

ix). We would like to learn from the reviewer what
co-ordination he means, and what he means by imagining
expression of partisan spirit under Agnismrti or Agastya-
samhita. —_

x). "Regarding the final suggestion of the reviewer, we
might inform him that thanks to the courtesy of many
scholars the Catalogus Catalogorum Office does have a wide
circle of scholars to co-operate in the work.

Any help which the reviewer could give, will be thank- »

fully received and acknowledged by the office.

164 COMMENT AND CRITICISM

No. |. Items i-iv and vi-vii of his reply call for no comment,
as he apparently does not underestimate the importance
of my suggestions. With regard to items v and ix, | do not
see why he should think otherwise. The editors of an en-
cyclopzedic reference work like the present one should be
on their guard lest they join any side in discussions which
are still not closed. The safest course would be to state
the views and let the world of scholars draw the legitimate
inference. The attempt to explain away item No. vii is
feeble and unconvincing. To take intercalary months as
equivalent to or embracing all kinds of impurities is a course
which the orthodox smrti scholar would hesitate to accept.
We welcome the assurance that incorporation of references
in works not known but quoted, is receiving its proper share
of attention, and we hope this will be consistently com-
plied with. Ifthe Board of Editors think that all scholarly
and provincial interests are well represented in their scheme,
we have nothing further to say. What 1 suggested was
that the important MSS. in different provincial scripts should
preferably be referred to those that are intimately familiar
with those scripts, so as to avoid all chances of error.
Let us hope that the Board has undertaken its stupendous
task with thorough sense of its responsibility and is prompted
by the sole consideration of advancement of learning.

Studien zur geschichte des Sivaismus: die Sivaitischen
systeme in der altjavanischen literatur. I. by A Zieseniss.—
In this very important paper the author has recognised the
importance of data in Old-Javanese literature for recons-
tructing the history of Saivism, and has taken great
pains to discover the systems of Saivism represented in
such works as Bhuvanakoga, Bhuvanasanksepa, Tativa sang
hyang Mahajfidna, etc. So far as Java is concerned, it
throws a flood of light on the subject.

1. Two silver plate grants from the Bataiva Museum
by K. A. Nilakanta Sastri—The author edits two charters
preserved in the Museum of Batavia. The one was issued
by Vijayaraghava of Tanjore in 1658, conferring trading
rights and privileges on the Dutch Company. This charter
is written in Telugu. The other charter, written in Tamil,
was issued in 1676, when Ekoji confirmed the previous
grant of Vijayaraghava.

2. Note on cultural relations between South-India and
Java by W. F. Stutterheim—Amongst other things the
author offers a new interpretation of a much-debated
couplet in the Canggal inscription and seeks to identify the

a part of them.

3. Een bijzcitingsbeeld van Koning ‘Réjasa? by W.F.
Stutterheim—The writer supposes the image no. 143/18509

The ‘Antiquity of the Buddha-Image: The Cult of the Buddha.
By O. C, GANGOOLY.

No lack of techinacl skill or creative genius, but an indirect
injunction prevented native artists of India from rendering
Buddha’s personality in adequate plastic forms. Even
after Buddha’s image became current in Indian Buddhist
art, the canonical and artistic convention of omitting
his figure continued for some time. The earliest surviv-
ing text sanctioning image-worship was very probably
composed some time during the first part of Ist century
B.C. The earliest monumental example of Buddha image
in Gandhara school must be dated some time in Ist cen-
tury B.C, The available evidence, literary ormonumen-
tal does not permit ein! a earlist date of the Buddha
image.

Twelve Years of the Wandering
Life of Buddha

By Dr. P. C. BaccHi

A shcrt Buddhist text entitled She eul yeu king 3m
“Siitra on the twelve years of the wandering life of Buddha”
is preserved in a Chinese translation of the end of the 4th
century A.D, The importance of the text cannot be over-
estimated in view of the fact that certain portions of it have
been the object of a number of studies by eminent scholars _
(Cf, S. Lévi, Notes sur les Indo-Scythes, JA., 1897, 1, 24;
N. Péri, Les Femmes de Sakya-muni, BEFEO., XVIII, I,
20-31; S. Lévi, Pour histoire du Ramdyana JA., 1918, 83
(tirage); P. Pelliot, La théorie des quatre fils du Wiel, T’oung
Pao, XXII, 97f.; 5. Lévi, Devaputra, JA., 1934, 1-21). I have
therefore thought it fit to take up a ate, ‘of the whole text
in al] its aspects.

The She eul yeu king was Pe ritad into Chinese oe least
three times. The oldest translation was due to a Buddhist
scholar named Kalaruci who had gone to China either from
India or from the Indian colonies in the Far East. The
translation was made at Canton either in 266 or 288 A.D.
The ancient Chinese’ catalogues say ‘that Kalaruci’s transla-
tion was in existence till the sixth century, but it was subse-

a P. C. BAGCHI

quently lost. A second translation of the text was made at
Nanking in 392 A.D. by Kalodaka who is mentioned in the
Chinese sources simply as a Buddhist monk of foreign
origin. It is not clear whether he was an Indian or an
Indianised foreigner. Kalodaka’s translation still exists, A
third translation was made by Gunabhadra who went to
China in 435 A.D. and died there in 468 A.D. His transla-
tion therefore was made sometime between 435 and 468.
Gunabhadra’s translation was subsequently lost (Cf, Pellict,
Ibid., pp. 97f.; Bagchi, Le Canon Bouddhique en Chine, I,
pp. 115, 335, 386). Nanjio in his Catalogue, No. 1374, gives
a Sanskrit rendering of the name of the text as Dvuddaéa-
(varsa)-viharana-sittra which seems to be quite justified.
But his English translation of the name as “‘Siitra of twelve
(years) going for pleasure’’ is not quite correct. It will be
seen from our translation of the text that it deals with the
preaching of Buddha during the first twelve years of his
religious career after his attainment of Bodhi. ] have therefore
freely translated the name of the text as ‘Twelve years of
the wandering life of Buddha’ although literally it should be
Stra of the twelve wanderings.

Although the translations of Kalaruci and Gunabhadra
are now lost, a fragment -of one of them has been found in
a compilation of 516 A.D. entitled King liu yi siang made
by a Chinese Buddhist scholar named Pao-ch’ang. The
fragment which is not very extensive contains a description
of the different kingdoms in India. Kalodakoa’s translation,
as we shall see later on, ends abruptly with an incomplete
description of Jambudvipa. The passage contained in the
King liu yi siang forms a sort of suite of the present text.
That is why Prof, ‘Lévi (JA., 1918, p. 159}. expressed the
opinion that the extract was ‘really the last portion of Kalo-
daka’s. translation. which was : lost but was fortunately pre-
served in the present quotation. Prof. Pellict however
pointed out (ibid., p. 104) that Pao-ch’ang, the compiler of
the King lia yi siang, who lived in the beginning of the
sixth eentary and was responsible for ae quotation, was also

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 3

acquainted with Kalaruci’s translation. It is not therefore
impossible that the extract is from the earlier translation and
not from Kalodaka's translation.

Pelliot’s suggestion seems to be confirmed «by aoe
quotation from the She eul yeu king in a work of Seng-yeu
who also lived in the beginning of the sixth century and was
thus a contemporary of Pao-ch’ang. Seng-yeu’s work is the
She-kia p’u or “A history of the Sakyas’’ which is a very
extensive work, In the second section of Chap. I of his work
Seng-yeu gives a long quotation from the She eul yeu king
in regard to the origin of the Sakyas. It corresponds to the
first part cf Kalodaka’s text which we have translated (see
infra—from the commencement up to...“Suddhedana. He
was father of the Bodhisattva’). But there is considerable
difference between Kalodaka’s text and the quotation which
shows that Seng-yeu like Pao-ch’ang had before him the
earlier translation.

In regard to the She eul yeu king, a Chinese Catalogue
of the Buddhist Tripitaka, the Chong king mu lu, compiled
in 594 A.D., says that it is composed of extracts from more
extensive works. It is quite possible that the work was such
a compilation but the sources on which it drew upon cannot
be clearly traced. Some of the informations contained in
it seem to be quite original and not found in other texts.
The ancient Chinese authorities like Seng-yeu, Pao-ch’ang
and Tao-siuan, while speaking of the origin of the Sakyas,
consider the She eul yeu king as authoritative as the Agamas
and the Vinayas and as a matter of fact they have no cano-
"nical authority to cite for some information on the Sakya race
except the present text: We have already discussed Seng-
yeu's indebtedness to the present text. Tao-siuan (596-667)
A.D.), the founder of the Vinaya school in China was a
disciple of Hiuan-tsang. Two of his works the She-kia she

u “‘A history of the Sakya race’? and She-kia fang che
“A history of the Sakya country” relate to India. The
latter is a sort of abstract of the Si yu ki of Hiuan-tsang,
whereas. the former ‘is: of the nature - lof Shea p’ a of

4 P. C. BAGCHI

Seng-yeu. Tao-situan refers to the She eul yeu king on
several occasions in his She-kia she p’u in connection with
the names of the members of the Sadkya clan and their stature.
It is therefore clear that in the sixth and the seventh cen-
turies the Chinese Buddhist scholars attached a great im.
portance to the present work,

The She eul yeu. king does not therefore seem to have
been a Chinese compilation as it is not mentioned as such
by lthe ancient Chinese authorities. The fact that three
different translations were made of the same text shows that
there was an Indian original of the text. This original text
however was not a finished work, but an incomplete com-
pilation of the history of the Sakya race which included also
a description of the Jambudvipa over which the Gautama
Buddha exercised his spiritual authority. In regard! to the
latter part of the work the original was either incomplete
or mutilated, A glance at the text shows that it is composed
of different elements. Some of which may be traced to

different parts of the Vinaya and Agama works, The elements’

of its composition are the. following:

I. The life of ‘the Bodhisativa in the a-seng-k’i
{asarhkheya) kalpa. |

Il.. The life of the Bodhisattva in the Bhadrakalpa and

: the incarnation of the Bodhisattva.
IH. The history of the Bodhisattva and his family.

IV. Buddha’s predication during the first twelve years

of his religious coe is the fundamental
basis of the text]. ha. *

V.. A description of the Jambudvipa and the various
countries and islands in it. This portion has no
coherent relation, with the earlier portion and
comes in in: an abript a manner.

‘The importance. of the She eul yeu king in the first place

lies in the fact that it gives certain details of the life of
Buddha. which « are not found i in 1 other texts. The legendary
TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 5

history of the Bodhisattva of the asamkheya kalpa as given
in the first part of the text must have been taken from some
Jataka which | have not been able to trace. The story of
the descent of the Bodhisattva from the Tusita heaven is
net found exactly in the same form in which it is given in
the present text, The story of this descent is given in the
Mahdoastu (vol. U], pp. 1ff.} in somewhat similar language.
It is said that the Bodhisattva at the time of his descent. on
earth makes four observations (vilokita) in regard to the time,
place, continent and the family. In the present text it is
said that the Bodhisattva looked around from the Tusita
heaven tc see in which kingdom of the Jambudvipa he would
take birth. During his descent the elephant Yi-lo-man
{airavana) drew his chariot, He is described here as having
33 heads. “Each head has 7 trunks of which each-contains
a lake. In each lake there are 7 utpala lowers. Upon each
flower there is a beautiful girl.’ In the Mahdsudassana-
sutta (Dialogues of Buddha, Ill, p. 204) the elephant-king is
described as “‘seven-fold”’ -satta-ppatittho, The translators
have explained this expression as meaning the “‘four legs,
two tusks and trunk.’ But the real meaning seems to be
the same as that found in the present text.

In the present text it is said that Buddha had three wives.
The first wife was Kiu-yi (Gopi) the daughter of the noble
Jalaprabha (Shuei Kuang—‘water-bright’} who was of the
Sho-yi family which also belonged te the Gautama clan. The
mother of Kiu-yi (Gopi) was Candrakumari (Yue-niu: moon-
girl), Jalaprabha lived near the frontier of the kingdom of
Kapilavastu. The second wife. of the Bodhisattva was
Ye-wei-t’an (Yagodhara) who was the daughter of the noble
Ye-she (Yaéa}. Yagodhara was the mother of Lo-yu (Rahula).
The third wife was Lu-yi (Mrgaja} who was the daughter of
the noble She (Sakya?), The text further says that three
different palaces were made for. the Bodhisattva and each
palace was provided with 2,000 dancing girls, This elaborate
arrangement for the pleasure of the Bodhisattva was made
because he.was destined to be a Che-kia-yue (Cakravartin).

6 P. C. BAGCHII

This tradition about the three wives of the Bodhisattva
runs contrary to the Pali tradition which has been so long
implicitly relied upon. M. Péri in his masterly article, al-
ready referred to, has made a comprehensive study of all
canonical and non-canonical texts relating to the wives of
the Bodhisattva. He has shown that although one wife of
Buddha either called Gopa or Yagodhar& is mentioned in
a certain number of texts, in a number of equally ancient
texts three distinct wives of the Bodhisattva have been
clearly mentioned. Thus in the M@élasarvastivdda-vinaya
there is mention of the three wives: Yaéodhara, the
daughter of Dandapani, Gopika, the daughter of Kinkini-
évara and Mrgaja, the daughter of Kalakrama (2). In a life
of Buddha entitled the Siu hing pen ki king translated into
Chinese -in. 197 A.D. there is mention of Gopa, the daughter
of Suprabuddha and besides of two other wives of whom
the names are given in Chinese as Ching-ch’eng-wei and
Ch’ang-lo-yi. In another life of Buddha translated into
Chinese in the 10th century and entitled the Chong hiu mo
ho ti king there is mention of Yagodhara, Gopika and Mregaja.
Thus it is the tradition contained in the Mdlasarvastivadda-
vinaya which is followed in these texts as well as in the
She eul yeu king.

There is some discrepancy regarding the names of the
fathers of the three wives. In some sources it is said that
the father of Gopa was Dandapani whereas in other sources
he is mentioned as the father of Yagodhara. But the tra-
dition is probably stated in ‘the most correct form
in the Fo pen hing tsi king which was translated into Chinese
in the sixth century. It is said there that Mahanaman was
the father of ‘Yagodhara, . while Dandapani was the father of
Gautami which was probably: another name of Gopa as she
belonged to the Gautama race. “Mahanaman is apparently
the same as. Yaga of the’ She eul yeu king because the two
names mean the same thing: glory, great glory. It is diffi-
cult to say why we. get the name Shuei yue lit, Jalaprabha
in the She eul yeu. king instead of Dandapani mentioned in
TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 7

other sources. But there is no doubt that they are the same
person. Dandapani belonged to the Sakya race, Jalaprabha
also belonged to the same race, It is clearly stated in our
text that the name of the family to which he belonged was
Sho-yi and that of his clan was Gautama. M. Péri (loc. cit.,
p. 20) has taken Sho-yi as Sravasti. But that is not evidently
correct. The old transcription cf the name of Sravasti in
Chinese is Sho-wei. Besides in two other places of the
She eul yeu king the same name Sho-yi occurs. The first of
the Sakya clan is called Sho-yi jen. Then again when the
stature of the different members of the Sakya clan is des-
cribed it is said that the height of the body of other ‘“‘persons
belonging to the Sho-yi family’’ was 14 ft. Sho-yi therefore
seems to be an archaic transcription of the name Sakya.
In old pronounciation Sho-yi was something like gia’ (g)i
(Sagya<Sakya). Thus it seems that the noble Shue-yue
(Jalaprabha) who was the father of Gopi or Gopa belonged
to the Sakya family and was the same person as mentioned
in other sources as Dandapani. The father of Mrgaja is
according to certain sources Kalakrama or Kalika but accord-
ing to the She eul yeu king-he was again a She i.e. a Sakya.

The story of the conversion of S&riputra and Maudga-
lyayana as told in the present text is essentially the same
as that found in other texts for example in the Mahdavagga
(I, 24), Malasarvastivadavinaya (Taisho, 1444) and the Maha-
vastu (Ill, pp. 57). But She eul yeu king is the only source
which states that Maudgalyayana was.a general of the. country
of Mi-yi-lo (Mithila >), In all other sources both Sariputra and
Maudgalyayana are stated to have belonged to Brahmanical
families. In the Mahdvastu the story is given as follows:
Upatisya was the son of a rich Brahmin of Nalanda which was
at a distance of half a yojana from Rajagrha. He was also
known as Sariputra as his father’s name was Sari. He went to _
the houses of a Guru at Kolitagrama for the study of the
Vedas. The Guru was a rich Brahmin of the Maudgalyagotra.
The latter's son was Kolita. Upatisya and Kolita became fast
friends, There were five hundred students but Upatisya

8 P. C. BAGCHI

and Kolita completed their studies earlier. The two friends
often met each other even after the completion of their
studies. Once both of them went to attend the arnual festi-
val of the Giryagrasamaja, Kolita went in great pomp in
a chariot driven by four horses and accompanied by a
thousand servants. The two friends on account of their pre-
vious merit developed a dislike for worldly things and decid-
ed to take to religious life, They first became the disciple
of Safijaya Vairatiputra, They were however dissatisfied
with the latter’s way and soon separated. Buddha was then
at Venuvana. The Bhiksu Upasena had come to the city
of Rajagrha for alms. Sariputra saw him and questioned
him about his teacher. Just after the first exchange of words
with Upasena Sariputra got the spiritual light. When
Sariputra came back to the place where Maudgalyayana was
waiting the latter at once perceived the change in him. He
then hastened to ask him: ‘‘How is your teacher called?
What has he taught you.” Sariputra replied: “The Tatha-
gata has. taught the dharmas which have a cause and also their
cause. The great Sramana has also spoken on its cessation.’
The two friends then went to the Venuvana. Buddha foresaw
that they were coming, announced it to his disciples and had
seats prepared for them. After their initiation Sariputra be-
came an Arhat in 7 days and Maudgalyayana in 15 days.

The name of the Bhiksu who gave the first information to
Sariputra is here Upasena, but in our text it is given as the
‘‘master of horse’’—Aévajit, That is the name which is also
found in the Pali Vinaya, The law of Buddha is described
by Aévajit to Sariputra in. our text as follows: ““According
to Buddha all dharma has a cause. (He also speaks on) its
destruction, on the extinction of: all pains and on nirvana.”
It is not quite the same as that expressed i in: the famous verse—
Ye dharma_heiuprabhava...by which Sariputra first describes
the law of Buddha but the four Aryan truths (catodri
Gryasatyani). The scene is placed in our text on the road
from Venuyana to Sravasti but. elsewhere at Venuvana in
Rajagrha, th ia :

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA g

The conversion of Sariputra and Maudgalyayana took
place according to our text in the fifth year of his active
career as a teacher, The principal events of the first twelve
‘ years of his career are given in the text, They do not quite
agree with what we know from. other sources, According
to the present text, Buddha left the house in the 29th year
and practised asceticism for six years. He attained Bodhi
in the 35th year of his life. From the 8th day of the 4th
month till the 15th day of the 7th month he remained seated
under the Bodhi tree. This was the first year of his active
career. From this account it appears that the 8th day of the
4th month was the day when he attained Bodhi. It ig accord-
ing to all Indian tradition the full moon day of V aigakha. This
can be the 8th day of the 4th month according to a Calen-
dar (8th April) which commenced in January. He remained
under the Bodhi tree up to the 15th day of the 7th month
which according to the same Calendar would be the 15th
July (Sravana), He stayed under the tree for about 14 weeks.
It was then that he started for the Deer Park to make his
first disciples.

There is no confirmation of this account in other sources.
All other accounts unanimously tell us that after the attain-
ment of Bodhi, Buddha stayed under the tree and in its
neighbourhood for seven weeks. It was on the last day,
that the two merchants Tapussa arid Bhallika came and
offered him food. They became his first lay disciples. Buddha
then thought of revealing his spiritual knowledge to others.
He first thought of his former teacher Udraka, but he found
out that the latter had died the previous night, He then
thought of his five former associates of the Deer Park at
Benares. But he left the Bodhi tree only on the full moon
day of Asadha i.e. eight weeks after the attainment of
Bodhi, This account is quite reasonable for the fact that the
full moon day of Asadha was the beginning of the Varsavasa.
It was therefore necessary for Buddha, according to the ascetic
practices of those days, to leave the open space and go to
a place of retreat on that ‘day: Le believe there is a mistake |

2

coe hee

10 P, C. BAGCHI

in the Chinese translation, We should have 6th month instead
of the 7th month.The [5th day of the 6th month would
correspond accordingly to the full moon day of Asadha. It
seems that the year of predication was calculated according
to the season of retreat (varsdvdsa). As the second year
in our account, too, commences with the arrival of the teacher
in the Deer Park it is quite natural that the day of his
departure from the precincts of the Bodhi tree was the
full moon day of Asadha.

In the second year, Buddha converted A-jo-kiu and his
friends, These were Ajfiata Kaundinya and his four friends
—Bhadrika, Vaspa, Aégvajit and Mahanaman. They are
otherwise known as the Bhadravargiyas or the Paficavargiyas
(Mahdvastu Il, pp. 329 ff.). The place of the conversion of
the Bhadravargiyas is wrongly given in some sources as
Uruvela (Kern, Manual, p. 24). The others converted in the
second year were Pi-p’o-tan, 17 men including Kia-che-lo,
the Elder Ta tsai, Eul tsai nien, Yiu-po-yi and the Nirgra-
ntha Cheng nien. He preached the law also to 42 men
including Ti-ho-kie-lo fo (Dipamkara Buddha). This is not
confrmed by other accounts. Pi-p’o-tan and Kia-che-lo are
not known from other sources. The Sresthi Ta-tsai (lit.
great talent) may be the same as Yaga. Yaéa was a rich
merchant of Benares. He along with his wife and 54 friends
received ordination from Buddha shortly after the conver-
sion of the Bhadravargiyas (Kern, ibid., p. 24), Yiu-po-yi-
*Upaga seems to be the same as Upaka, an Ajivika monk,
whom the Buddha met on his way to the Deer Park. Upaka
was much impressed by the appearance of Buddha and made
enquiries about the law followed by him (Kern, ibid., 23).

In the third year Buddha converted the three disciples
of Kaéyapa as well as 1000 disciples of theirs. The three
disciples of Kagyapa were Uruvela Kagyapa, Nadi Kaéyapa.
and Gaya Kaéyapa. Their conversion took place at Uruvela
where Buddha had. retired in the third season of retreat.
This account agrees with all other sources (Kern, ibid., p. 24).

The Haprenitere of the fourth ‘year also are” ‘confirmed

“TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 11

to some extent by other accounts. According to the present
text Buddha went to the mountain called Siang-t’eu
(Gaja-Sirsa) where he converted all kinds of supernatural!
beings, Gajegirsa hill is the same as the Gayagirga hill of
ether accounts. It was not far from Uruvela. According to
other accounts, Buddha went to the Gayaégirsa hill accom-
panied by the three Kaéyapas whem he had just converted
and gave there a sermon on the Gditya-parydya. All his
hearers there were converted (Kern, ibid., p, 24). The
principal events of the fifth year were the conversion of
Sse-ho-mei (2?) who is not otherwise known and that of
Sariputra and Maudgalyayana which we have already
discussed.

In the present text it is said that in the sixth year Siu-ta
(Sudatta) and Prince Che-t’o (Jeta) made for Buddha a
Sangharama, 12 pagodas, 72 halls, 3600 rooms and 500
towers, This is evidently a reference to the gift of the Jeta-
vana at Sravasti by Sudatta who is also known as Anatha-
pindika. According to other sources the sole donor was
Sudatta. He purchased the Jetavana from Prince Jeta at a
fabulous price and erected a splendid monastery, in the
midst a private room (gandhakuti) for the master and all
around separate dwellings for the senior monks, cells etc.
(Kern,ibid., p. 28). The exact number of these constructions
is not given in other sources. .

The events of the 7th, 8th and 9th years, as recorded in
the present text, are not quite clear, Buddha was in the
country of Kiu-ye-ni in the 7th year. Kiu-ye-ni- * Ku-zia-ni
seems to be Kuéinagara. Buddha, we are told, communi-
cated the Pan-cheu-king to eight men including the Bodhi-
sattva So-t’o-ho. Two texts Pan-cheu-king were translated
as early as the end of the 2nd century A.D. by the Yue-che
Lokaksema (Hobogirin, nos. 417, 418). The Sanskrit titles
of the texts have been restored as Bhadrapala-sittra, The
name of the Bodhisattva is. not known from other sources.
In the 8th year Buddha resided on the mountain Liu and
converted King Chen-t’o-lo—Candra, In the 9th year he was

Iz P. C. BAGCHI

in the lake Wei and converted T’o-kiu-mo. These infor-
mations are not confirmed by other sources. Wei may be a
mistake for an-wei which would have rendered the name
of the lake Anavatapta (Pkt. anotatia), Some of the legen-
dary accounts would have us believe that Buddha went to
the Anavatapta lake and converted the Naga king there.

In the 10th year Buddha came back to Mo-kie (Magadha)
and coverted Fo-kia-sha. The person converted seems to
be Pukkusa who was a disciple of Aldra Kalama. The
place of his conversion is given in other sources as Pava
(Kern, ibid., p. 43), The event of the I Ith year is not recorded
in other sources. We are told that Buddha spoke on the
past life to Maitreya under “the. fearful tree’’ (>). From
other sources we learn that Buddha passed some time in the
Deer Park of a Yaksa called Bhayamkara in the country
of the Bhargas, The name of the Yaksa is also given as
Bheskala in some texts (Kern, ibid., p. 34).

The main events of the 12th year, as recorded in the
present text, were Buddha’s return to Kapilavastu, conver-
sion of Ch’a-mo-kie on the way to the city and conversion
of the members of the Sakya clan. Ch’a-mo-kie may be
Sumagadha, who .was the daughter of _ Anathapindika,
married to a rich merchant of the Anga country, Buddha
had been to the Anga country to pay her a visit (Kem, ibid.,
p. 38). .
In a résumé of event in the Chinese text it is said that
Buddha visited 14 countries in course of these twelve years.
There are three lacunze in the Chinese text which have been
indicated by dots in our translation. Inspite of these lacune
it is clear that the number of countries mentioned are only
seven, The number 14 has been given by taking into consi-
deration the Chinese translations of the seven names. The
seven countries visited by Buddha are the following: (1). The
country of king Po-sse-jo (Pasenadi-Prasenajit) i.e. Kosala.
The name of Prasenajit is translated as ho-yue ‘‘joyful.”
The old transcription Po-sse-jo. can be restored only as
Pasena, This was understood by the Chinese translator as
TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 13

“joyful’’ (-prasanna). (2). Kia-wei-lo-yue—Kapilavastu—the
translation of the name as miao-to “‘good merit” is quite
regular (Rosenberg, Vocabulary, p. 130). (3). Sho-wei—Sri-
vasti; the Chinese translation—wu wu pu yu literally means
abhava-nihsativa “‘without substance, without character’.
This was the translation of a symbolical name of Sravasti
as in the case of Kapilavastu. In the case of Vaiéali also
we will find such a name. (4). Wei-ye-li—Vaiéali, there are two
Chinese translations of the name. Kuang-ta “‘vast’’ is the
literal translation of the name. The other fu sheng sse
“saving from birth and death” is, | believe, the translation
of the symbolical name. (5). Lo-yue-ki is Rajagrha, The
Chinese translation of the name as wang she “‘king’s house’’
is more commonly found in the texts than the transcribed
name. (6). Kiu-leu is evidently a transcription of the name
Kuru. The translation of the name as che she kuo “‘the
country of the masters of knowledge”’ is a reference to the
old tradition that the Kuru country was famous for its lore
of knowledge. (7). Po-lo-nai—Varanasi. Lu-ye- “‘Deer Park”
(Mrgadava) is wrongly given as translation of the name of
the country.

It may be reasonably questioned-why the present text
gives a description of the activities of Buddha only for
twelve years. The cycle of events as described here is a
perfectly complete cycle, After.Buddha had taken the deci-
sion of preaching his law to others he set out on his self-
imposed errand, visited all the principal countries in
North-India and ultimately returned to the country of his
nativity where he preached his law to his own people and
converted them. The ‘subsequent career of Buddha as
described in other sources is nothing but a repetition of
visits to the same old centres and conversion of other peoples
who did not play any significant part in the history of the
faith. Were these twelve years the whole career of Buddha
according to the earlier sources?

It may be pointed out that even actoraines to other sources
there is a complete blank in the career ‘of Buddha for twenty-

14 P. C. BAGCHI

three years. There is in these sources a narration of events up
to the 20th year of Buddha’s religious career. There is then a
blank of 23 years. After that, there is a resumption of the
account of what happened during the last eight years of
Buddha's life (Kern, ibid., p. 38)

The blank is explained in the following manner in an
account of the Fo shuo pa ta ling t’a hao king which |
translated some time ago ({. H. Q. XVII, pp. 223 ff.). The
text was rendered into Chinese by Fa-t’ien towards the end
of the 10th century. The text contains the following gathas :

“Twenty-nine years “| passed in the royal palace.
For six years | practised asceticism on the snowy
mountain, For five years | converted men in the
city of Rajagrha. For four years | stayed in the
Pi-sha forest. For two years I stayed peacefully
on the Jo-li-yen (Nairafijana), For twenty-three
years I stayed in Sravasti. In the city of Vaiéali, in
the Mrgadava, Mo-kiu-li and Trayastriméa heaven,
She-shu-na‘ and Kiao-shen-mi ( Kauéambi) on the
peak of the Ratnacaitya mountain and in wilder-
ness, in the town of Wei-nu, Fei-lan-ti, in the city
of Kia-pi, the capital of king Suddhodana,
each of these places the Sakya Tathagata travelled
and stayed for one year—thus eighty years he
lived in this world. Afterwards the meu-ni (muni)
entered Nirvana. .

Pi-sha (wrongly printed in the article referred to, as Pikha)
seems to be the same as Bheskala forest which belonged to
the country of the Bhargas. Mo-kiu-li may be Mucalinda, the
Naga, in whose place Buddha-stayed for some time. She-.
shu-na is the Sirnéumaragiti,. the capital of the Bhargas. Wei-
nu may be Venuvana. Fei-lan-ti is Verafija. The blank of 23
years is explained here asa “stay in Sravasti’’. According
to this account the first period consists of the activities
during the first eleven years. after the attainment of Bodhi.
It was. followed by 23 years’. stay in Sravasti. The last
period consists. of eight or nine years. There is a mistake
TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 15

in the calculation by one or two years. The first period of
active career probably lasted for eleven years. Then came
the prolonged stay of twenty-three years at Sravasti. That
would make in all 80 years (29+6+11+23+9+2=80 years).
From this account too it appears that the period of Buddha’s
activities lasted for twelve years including the year of his

attainment of Bodhi. It was followed by the long period of

blank. The account of the She-eul-yeu-king in this regard
seems to have a special significance,

Il

The text contains the first literary mention in a text of
Indian origin of Devaputra in the special sense in which
the Kushans used it in India. In the last section of the
text which concerns Jambudvipa it is said that there are four
Devaputras—‘‘Sons of Heaven’’ (Chinese T’ien-tseu}. “In
the East there is the Devaputra of the Tsin. The people are
prosperous there. In the South there is the Devaputra of
the country of T’ien-chu, The country*is much noted for its
elephants. In the West there is the Devaputra of Ta-ts’in.
The country produces goid, silver, gems and jade, In the
North-West there is the Devaputra of the Yue-che, The
country produces many good horses.”’ Thus the four
countries which possessed Devaputras were Tsin—China,
Tien-chu—India, Ta-ts’in—Roman Orient, and the Yue-che
country or the Indo-Scythian Empire.

lt is now admitted that the Kushan Emperors borrowed
the title Devaputra—‘‘Son of Heaven’’ from China. Kaniska,
Huviska, Vasudeva, all use this title. The kings of Khotan
who were most probably connected with the Kushans use
the same title in the Kharosthi documents of the Stein
Collection, Tien-tseu or the ‘Son of Heaven” was the regular
title of the Emperor of China. It did not have that special
significance anywhere else. The Kushan; Emperors were
the first to establish contact with China, Persia and the
Roman Empire and to use titles signifying the Imperial dignity
in all the countries with which they entertained relations,

16 P. C. BAGCHI

As the Emperor of India they used the common, Indian
title maharaja. But they also borrowed the title rajatiraja
‘the king of kings’” from Iran, the title of devaputra—'‘the
son of Heavens’ from China and most probably the title of
kaisara (Czesar) from the Roman Empire. The reading of
the last title which is found only in the Ara Inscription of
Vajeshkaputra Kaniska (Konow, Corpus, p. 165) is doubt-
ful. It is however quite probable that a great Kushan king
would use such a title, as it was the last of a series of titles
known to him signifying the Imperial dignity.

A number of references to the Kushan use of the title of
Devaputra found in almost contemporary literature has been
cited by Profs. Lévi and Pelliot. The commentary of the
Mahaprajfiigparamita by Nagarjuna which has been preserved
in a Chinese translation of Kumarajiva under the title of
Ta che tu luen mentions four kinds of gods—‘‘gods by name,
gods by birth, gods by purity, and gods by natural purity.’
The text further says that the god ky name “is now the
king whom one calls’ Devaputra."” In a Chinese text entitled

Nan cheu yi wu che compiled by Wan-chen in the 3rd _

century A.D., now known only from some quotations in
other texts, it is clearly stated that ‘‘the king in the Yue-che
country is called the “son of Heaven’—(Devaputra).”’ Last.
ly 1 believe that. the same tradition is recorded, but in a
slightly altered form, by MHiuan-tsang. While speaking
about the kingdom of Kie-p’an-t’o (Tash Kurghan) in the
Pamirs, the pilgrim tells us that the rulers of the country
styled themselves Chi-na-t’i-p'i-k’iu-tan-lo (Cina-deva-gotra)
as they claimed descent from a- Chinese lady and the sun-
god (Watters, On Yuan Chwang, II, p. 286; Beal—Buddhist
Records, II, p...300).. Devagotra in’ this case is reminiscent
of Devaputra, the. title used by the Kushans,. Tash Kurghan
which is on the way from. Kashmir to Kashgar was certainly
one of the most important Yue-che outposts towards Central
Asia. It is therefore quite natural that. even in the 7th century
a petty ruling dynasty i in. the jnaccessible mountains would still
call themselves Devaputra eee claim through it a relation-

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 17

ship with China. Chi-na-t’i-p’o-k’iu-tan-lo may be as well
a mistake for—t’i-p’o-fo-tan-lo (Devaputra) which Yi-tsing
mentions on two occasions. In one of his works (Chavannes,
Mémoire sur les Religicux éminents, p. 56, n. 3) he refers to
T’i-p’o-fo-tan-lo (Devaputra) as the title of the Emperor
who resided at the Chinese capital, In another work (Records
of the Buddhist Practices, Takakusu, p. 136) he explains it
more fully, ‘“When they (Indians) hear that one is a priest
of Devaputra (T’i-p’o-fo-tan-lo) all pay great honour and
respect, wherever one goes, Deva (ti-po) means ‘hea-
ven’ (tien) and putra (fo tan lo) means ‘son’ ({tseu); the
priest of the Devaputra is more fully ‘One who has come
from ithe place where dwells the Son of Heaven of Cina
(China).”’ /

Devaputra in this special sense is used in a section of the
Suvarnaprabhdsa-sittra which has been discussed in detail] by
Prof. Lévi and compared by him with its different Chinese
and Tibetan translations. The most significant lines-are the
following :

kin capi manuse loke jayate Sriyate nrpah
api vai devasambhiito devaputrah sa ucyate.
trayastrimngair devardjendrair bhago datto ......

“Although he is born and although he flourishes in the
world of men but as his existence depends on the gods he is.
called devaputra, The thirty-three greatest kings of gods
all give him a portion each...”’.

Prof, Lévi has shown that the Brahmanical texts like the
Manusarnhita and the Mahabharata contain similar ideas on
the divine origin of royalty, but there is no mention of the title
devaputra. Kaniska was a patron of Mahayana, The
Suvarnaprabhasa-sitra is a very ancient Mahayana work.
The special importance which it attaches to the title deva-
putra in the sense in which the. Kushan emperors used it
shows that the text was compiled in the Kushan period.

The title devaputra according to Prof. Lévi was
introduced in India by the -Yue-che - through an Iranian
medium. ‘The Yue-che emperors’’, Prof, Lévi says, “‘before

3

8 P. C. BAGCHI

introducing in India the Imperial title which they had picked
up from the Chinese in course of their perigrenations in
order to round the Pamir, had been in contact, as well as
in conflict, with the people speaking an Iranian language
who extended up to Central Asia. They were specially in
contact with the Arsacidan dynasty, the successors of the
Seleucides, who had extended their empire up to the fron-
tiers of India. It was certainly in this region that an Iranian .
translation of the Chinese title #’ien-tseu was elaborated and
fixed under the form bagpuhr’’, This Arsacidan form
bagpuhr was according to Lévi the intermediary through
which the Chinese tien-tseu became devaputra,

But the presence of the title bagpuhr in Iranian can be
ascertained only through a Sogdian intermediary  #ypwr
which occurs in a solitary old Sogdian letter which was
found in a mutilated condition. The Arab geographers and
travellers of later times mention the title either as baghbur
or as faghfur which must have reached them through Persian
sources, But the intermediate stages are unknown. Besides
the Chinese sources which alone speak of the migration of
the Yue-ches to the Oxus valley and of their ultimate con-
quest of India do not say that the earlier Yue-che rulers
used the title. The Kushans only used this title after the
conquest of India and after the foundation of an empire
which extended from the Hindukush up to Eastern India.
Devaputra was not the only title which they used, They
used besides, the titles of Maharaja, Rajatiraja and probably
also Kaisara. It was therefore the deliberate expression of
the sentiment of vainglory on the part of the first Kushan
Emperor of India.: It is thus more likely that ‘Devaputra’
was not conceived after an Iranian original like bagpuhr
but directly after the Chinese tradition. The Kushan
Emperors of India had direct relation with China, It must
be remembered that the ancient Khotanese rulers who had
Kushan affinities use the Indian title devaputra inspite of the
fact that. the local. language. of Khotan was a form of Eastern
hranian, It is therefore more probable that the Iranian
‘TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 19

bagpuhr instead of being the basis of the Sanskrit devaputra
was an adaptation of the Sanskrit title.

It is true that the passage of the She eul yeu king which
we have already quoted and which mentions the four Deva-
putras of the Jambudvipa places the Yue-che country out-
side India. It,locates China in the East, India in the South,
Ta-ts’in (Roman Orient) in the West and the Yue-che
country in the North-West. But the starting point of this
geographical distribution is not clear. Ta-ts'in was in the
West and China in the East in relation to Iran. But how could
the Yue-che country be placed in the North-West in the same
sense, The importance lies not in the geography but in the fact
that the compiler of the She eul yeu king knew that the
Emperor of China was known as Devaputra and, so also the
Yue-che (Kushan) Emperors of India. For him devaputra
was a title which conveyed the sense of a paramount ruler
and that is why he used it to describe the four great rulers
of the world known, to him.

The ‘‘theory of the four sovereigns” has been discussed
by Prof. Pelliot in great detail in his article which | have
already mentioned. He has quoted various texts in which
this theory has been elaborated and has also tried to trace
similar notions in India but without much success, The
Chinese and Arabic sources, as he has shown, are full of
references to this theory but such references in Indian ~
sources are very meagre,

Hiuan-tsang in the introduction to his Si-yu-ki first of all
gives a description of the Buddhist cosmology and then
introduces the story of the four great sovereigns of Jambu-
dvipa and their respective countries. The Buddhist cosmo-
logy as given by Hiuan-tsang is the same as found in other
Buddhist texts, for example in the Abhidharmakoéa (Vallée
Poussin, [I], pp. 45ff.).. According to this cosmology there
are four islands: Videha in the East,. Jambu in the South,
Godaniya in the West and Kuru in. the North. The. king
whe rules over all the four islands i is - called ‘ ‘Gold Wheel
king” (suvarna-cakravartin), ‘The Eg who rules over the

20 P. C. BAGCHI

three islands excepting the northern one is called the ‘‘Silver
Wheel king’’ (raupya-cakarvartin), The ruler of two islands
--Jambudvipa and Videha are called “‘Copper Wheel king’
(tamra-cakravartin), The “Iron Wheel king’’ (ayas-cakar-
vartin) bears sway only on the Jambudvipa. How this
gradual decay in the sovereign power of the kings took
place has been told in the She eul yeu king (§. ID) with
reference to the kings of the Sakya race. Destruction of
life was the cause which gradually brought about this deca-
dence. It also shortened the life of the rulers and brought
diseases on. earth, While speaking about the Cakravartin
rulers the She eul yeu king however speaks of the four
heavens (Vien) instead of the four dvipas. The Iron Wheel .
king is according to it the king of the Southern Heaven
which corresponds to the Southern Island or Jambudvipa
of. other sources.

Hiuan-tsang then speaks of the four great sovereigns of
the Jambudvipa. The information given by him is not
found in any other Buddhist cosmological source, He tells
us (Watters, 1, pp. 35f.) that when the last Cakravartin king
(i.e. the Iron Wheel king) ceased to exist, the Jambudvipa
was divided amongst four sovereigns. These four sovereigns
were the Elephant-Lord (Gajapati) in the South, the Lord of
Precious substances (Ratnapati) in the West, the Horse-Lord
(Agvapati) in the North and Man-Lord (Narapati) in the East.
Watters has summarised the passage thus:

“In the South is the Elephant-Lord whose territory ‘has a
hot moist climate with people energetic, devoted to study. and
addicted to magical arts, wearing garments which cress the
body and leave the right shoulder bare: their hair is made
into a topknot in the middle and hangs down on the sides:
they associate in towns and. live in houses of several storeys.
In the West is. the Lord of Precious Substances who rules
over the sea abounding i in pearls, whose subjects are rude
and covetous, wear short coats fastened to the left, cut their
hair short and have long mustachios; they live in towns also:

and ‘are. traders.” The -Horse-Lord rules. in the North; his

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA at

country is very cold yielding horses, and, with inhabitants
of a wild fierce nature who commit murder without remorse,
they live in felt tents and are migratory herdsmen. In. the
East is the Man-Lord who has a well-peopled territory with
a genial climate where all good manners and social virtues
prevail and the people are attached to the soil.”
Tao-siuan, who summarised the Si-yu-ki in his She kia
fang che, has identified the four sovereigns of the Jambu-
dvipa mentioned by Hiuan-teang but in rather vague terms.
We identifies the Elephant-Lord (Gajapati) with the king
of India, the Lord of Precious Substances (Ratnapati) with
the king of Hu (the barbarians), the Horse-Lord (Asvapati)
with the T’u-kiue (Turks), and. the Man-Lord (Narapati)
with China. He adds that in the country of the Elephant-
Lord the king rules the country with the help of “soldiers
mounted on elephants.’’ In a later work named the Siu
kao seng chuan (compiled between 664 and 667) Tao-siuan
gives a more precise identification of the four regions while
narrating the biography of Hiuan-tsang. He says that in
India there is a tradition that Jambudvipa is governed
by four kings. ‘The East is called Che-na (Cina)—the lord
of the country is the king over men. The West is called
Po-sse (Persia), the lord of the country is the king over gems.
The South is called Yin-tu (India)—the lord of the country
is the king over elephants.” The North is called Hien-yun
(Hieng-nu, i.e. Turks etc.}—the lord of the country is the
king over horses’’. Sao Fe. |
It is quite clear from this that Tao-siuan was trying to
elaborate the information supplied’ by Hiuan-tsang either
verbally or through the Si-yu-ki, in the light of the geographi-
cal knowledge then possessed by the Chinese scholars. We
have already seen that Tao-siuan knew the She eul yeu king
and utilised it on several occasions for his compilation of the
She-kia she p’u. But he does not follow the identification of
regions as given in that text—China in the East (noted for
the prosperity of its. people}, T’ien-chu- (India) in. the. south
{noted for its elephant), Ta-ts'in (Roman Orient) in the West

Bade P. C. BAGCHI

(noted for its precious substances}, and Yue-che in the
North-West (noted for its horses). The reason is quite evi-
dent. Ta-ts’in and Yue-che had ceased to exist in the time
of Hiuan-stang and Tao-siuan. So instead of these he gives two
names of real significance in his time—Po-sse (Persia) in the
West and T’u-kiue (Turks) in the North. Therefore the
theory of the four sovereigns—Narapati, in the East,
Gajapati in the South, Aégvapati in the North (or North-
West, and Ratnapati in the West, is the most important issue
of what has been said. Their association with certain geo-
graphical areas has not the same importance. The theory
was used, by each author in his own way. The Arab geogra-
phers of later times, as Prof, Pelliot has shown, did the same
thing. Two important texts have been cited by Prof. Pelliot
in this respect, In a text dated 851 attributed, to one Sulayman
the following statement occurs:

“The people of India and China are of unanimous
opinion regarding the fact that the (great) kings of the earth
are four in number. The foremost of the four kings accord-
-ing to them is the king of the Arabs (i.e, the Khalif of
‘Baghdad). The Indians and the Chinese agree without
any contradiction as to the fact that the king of the Arabs
is the greatest of kings, .the richest and the most magni-
ficent. He is the king of the great religion (Islam) above
which there is none. The king of China places himself in
the second rank after the king of the Arabs. Next come
the king of Rum Pyzantinn) and the Ballahra (Vallabbar
raja or the Calukya king).”

The other text is the account of a conversation of Ibn
Wahab with the Emperor of China. Ibn Wahab was grant-
ed an audience by the Emperor sometime between 872 and
875. The account which is of the beginning of the 10th
century, runs. as follows:

“The king (i.e.-the Emperor of China} then asked. How
do you classify the kings {of the earth), The king told the
interpreter, “Tell Ibn: ‘Wahab that we, Chinese, we count
five kings. He ‘who possesses, the: richest. kingdom is the
o SCP Se

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 23

king of Irak, because Irak is in the centre of the world and
other kingdoms surround it, In China one calls him the
king of kings. After him comes the king of China whom
we call the king of men because there is no other king who
can establish the basis of peace better or maintain the order
better than what we de in our own country. There is no
other king of whom the subjects are more loyal to the king
than ours. This is the reason why the king of Chira is
called the king of men. Then comes the king of ferocious
beasis: this is the king of the Turks (of Toguz-Oguz) who
ig our neighbour. Then comes the king of elephants i.e. the
king of India. He is also called in China the king of wisdom
because wisdom is native in India. Last comes the king of
Rum (Byzantium) whom we call the king of fine men.”
These two pasages clearly show that the Arab travellers
alsu had access to the old theory of the four sovereigns and
that they were making use of it to their own advantage—
giving the highest place to their own ruler in the list. The
Arab. travellers might have picked it up in India, But a
more possible source of derivation was. the Buddhist lore
which was carried to Baghdad between 786 and 808 A.D. by
the Barmakide converts of Balkh (Sachau, Alberuni, p. xxxi).
But the theory whether picked up in India or, not was
long current in India, Prof. Pelliot has referred to a
traditien current in India and recorded by both Burnouf and
Lassen. The tradition says that after the fall of the Pandavas
India was divided amongst four kings: Narapati, Gajapati,
Chatrapati, and Aégvapati. In the Ain-i-Akbari there is a
description of the play of cards which are connected with
twelve kings. The first three are Aévapati, Gajapati and
Narapati. The fourth is the gadhpati which certainly means
the lord of forts (Hindi—gadh). The fifth is the dhanapati
(the lord of treasures—the same as the earlier ratnapati).
There is no mention of Chatrapati. - Lastly Prof, Pelliot
refers to a traditional list of kings given to Buchanan in 1807
which mentions Yudhisthita ~Vikramaditya, Salivahana,
Bhoja, then three kings, and‘ then tradition ‘says “‘After. this

24 P. C. BAGCHI

Naraputti, Gajaputti and Ashaputti, three thrones were esta-
blished."” The list communicated to Buchanan seems to
have been a traditional Rajavaméa similar to what is incorpo-
rated in the Tantras. [ have recently discussed one such Raja-
vamga(A new source of the political history of Kamariipa,
Ind, Hist: Quarterly, XVII, pp. 230 .) entitled Haragauri-
samvada, This list while speaking of the kings of the Kali
age mentions Yudhisthira, the Nandas, the Gautamas, the
Mayuras (Mauryas), the Pandavas (2), the Sakas, Vikra-
maditya and Bhoja. The list then says that with Bhoja the
line of Kgatriya rulers who were entitled to be Cakravarii
came to an end. This may have some historical signifi-
cance. King Bhoja was the founder of the Gurjara-Pratihara
Empire and had some claim to paramountcy. We shall see
later on that the inscriptions of the rulers belonging to some
of the petty dynasties which succeeded the Gurjara- Pratiharas
mention for the first time the three types of rulers—Asvapati,
Narapati and Gajapati.

It. is quite clear that the later Indian. oadition has teduced
the number of four sovereigns to three—Aégvapati, Gajapati
and Narapati. Ratnapati although found in the Ain-i-Akbari
under the name Dhanapati has been omitted probably because
it did not correspond, to anything known. But the number
had been so reduced still earlier. Of all the Indian inscrip-
tions only the later records of eleventh and twelfth centuries
mention the three lords, Aévapati, Gajapati and Narapati.
We know that after the Mahomedan conquest of North
_ Bengal the -successors of Laksmanasena continued to rule
as independent kings from Vikrampur_ (Dacca), Two of these
rulers Kegavasena and. Vigvariipasena who were ruling to-
wards the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the thir-
teenth centuries call themselves “Lord of the three kings’’—
Aévapati, Gajapati and Narapati—aésvapati-gajapati-narapati-
rajatrayadhipati (N.. “Majumdar, | Inscriptions of Bengal,
Varendra Research Society Publication, pp. 136, 145).

titles in this period. Govindacandra, Jayacandra and
Harigcandra of the Gahadavala dynasty, who ruled in the
12th century, call themselves overlord of Aévapati-Gajapati-
Narapati. Some of the Haihaya rulers, specially Karna and
his successor who ruled in the latter part of the [Ith and in
the 12th centuries call themselves—nija-bhujopdrajit-A gvapati-
Gajapati—Nerapati-raja-trayadhipati. The Candella Trailok-
yamalla who ruled in the 13th century use the same title
——nija-bhujoparjit...... raja-trayadhipati (See H. C., Ray—
Dynastic History of Northern India, 1, pp. 519, 532, 541.,. etc.
and Il, pp. 724-725, 784, 785, etc.). They do not mean
three particular rulers but only three kinds of rulers, No
importance can be attached to the usual claim made by
these petty rulers of the most ignominious period of Indian
history to overlordship of the three kinds of rulers. It how-
ever shows that the tradition was still alive, that paramount
sovereignty (cakravartin) implied mastery over the three
kinds of rulers—Aévapatiz Gajapati and Narapati. The
fourth in the list (Ratnapati) had been dropped. The
Sabdakalpadruma (sub. verb. cakra) gives a description of
different kinds of forts (Rotta) after a source entitled
Samaydmrta and in that connection it mentions different
kinds of rulers like the lords of Gaja, Agva and Ratha, the
Samanta, the Mandalegvara ete. (gaja$va-ratha-bhipalah
samantah mandalegvarah). In this text also gajapati, aévapati,
rathapati are taken as different types of rulers.

It is the same old theory of the four sovereigns bereft of
its geographical association, The geographical association
was a new accretion in every age: with the author of the
She eul yeu king it is India, China, Yue-che.country and the
Roman Orient; with Tao-siuan it is China, India, Persia and
T’u-kiue and with the Arabs it is. either Irak, China, Rum
(Byzantium) and India or Irak, China, India, (Toguz-Oguz)
and Rum. But Hiuan-tsang more faithful to Indian tradition
mentions only South (Gajapati), North (Aégvapati), East
(Narapati} and West (Ratnapati), The tradition survived in
India in a slightly modified form up to later times.

What was then the origin of the theory of four
sovereigns? It had apparently nothing to do with four tra-
ditional divisions of the army: hasti, agva, ratha and patti
i.e. elephant, horse, chariot and infantry (Cf. Mahdavyut-
patti—Sakaki, p. 252}. This fourfold army (caturanga-
balakdya) is always associated with any king whatsoever
and we do not hear of kings possessing only one of these
divisions, The Aévapati, Pilupati, and Narapati i.e. master
of men (officer in charge of the subjects) are also mentioned
in the Mahavyutpatti (ibid., pp. 256-257) but they are
merely officers of the king, None of them represents a parti.
cular type of ruler.

We have seen that the theory of the four sovereigns is
intimately connected, with the conception of the Cakravartin
ruler. In the golden age the Cakravartin was a ruler of the
four mythical worlds of the Buddhist cosmography—(Uttara)-
Kuru, (Purva)-Videha, Godaniya-and Jambudvipa. Through
gradual decay of power the Cakravartin came to be the ruler
of one world only, namely’ the Jambudvipa, The Cakra-
vartin. ruler of Jambudvipa was also the overlord of the ok
four types of kings: Aévapati, Gajapati, Narapati and ;
Ratnapati. With the disappearance of the last Cakravartin
the sovereignty of. Jambudvipa was divided amongst these
four types of rulers. In later traditions Chatrapati replaces
the Ratnapati but that also is soon dropped from the list;
only the first three remains: Aévapati, Gajapati, and Nara-_
pati, Even the _vainglorious rulers of the Sena dynasty of ae:
Bengal and a few other minor dynasties of Northern India 2
in order to establish a claim to the position of Cakravartin 1
call themselves 'the overlords of the three kinds of kings.

Therefore according to the old theory a-Cakravartin was
the overlord of the four’ kinds of kings : Agvapati, Gajapati,
Narapati and. Ratnapati. ~The ancient Buddhist texts men-
tion amongst other ‘requisite possessions of a Cakravartin
the seven treasures (sapta-raindni). These seven treasures

nayaka (Mahdvyutpatti, p. 251). The first four help the king
_to establish his supremacy quickly over the whole earth up
to the furthest limit of the horizon (cakravala). They are of
divine origin. But the next three Stri, Grhapati and Pari-
nayaka are of human origin. Grhapati is a householder.
That is the meaning attached to it in the Mahdvyutpatti
(Tib, khyim bdag). Parindyaka means a minister (Tib. blon
po). But in the Pali texts (Mahdsudassana-sutte. Digha
Nikaya—Dialogues of Buddha, vol, 11) Gahapati is interpreted
as a treasurer and Parindyaka as an adviser. Whatever may
be their real significance, the last three treasures of the
sapta-ratna viz., Stri, Grhapati and Parin&yaka are of human
origin and the master of these three may be simply styled
a Narapati. But it is not still clear if this conception of
seven treasures essential for a king to rise to the position of a
Cakravartin had anything to do with the old theory of the
four sovereigns. All the elements of the theory are there:
the best of horses (Aéva-ratna), the best of elephants (Hasti-
ratna), the best of gems (Mani-ratna) and the best of human
beings associated with him in three essential capacities as
wife, treasurer and minister (stri, ‘grhapati, and parindyaka).
Aévapati, Gajapati etc, may also be interpreted in these
senses i.e, not as the Lord of Horse, Lord of Elephant etc.
but as the king of horses, the king of elephants, etc.
However in the oldest source, the She eul yeu king in
which this theory of four sovereigns is found for the first
time, the theory is formulated in a different way. The four
Lords: Aégvapati etc. are so many sovereign rulers con-
nected with the four quarters: . North, South, West and
East. This seems to be an elaboration of another aspect of
the Cakravartin. A Cakravartin is one who is “the Lord of
the Four Quarters’ (Digha Nikaya, loc. cit.}. His sovereignty
extends in every direction up to the very end of the Cakra-
vala. But with the disappearance of.a Cakravartin the rulers
of the four quarters become independent. An Indian
author of the Kushan period would naturally be tempted to
elaborate this theory further in the light of the geographical

28 P. C. BAGCHI

knowledge possessed by him, The kings of the four
quarters according to the old theory were connected with
the essential requisites of the Cakravartin, agva, gaja, mani
and nara. In the north and the north-west the Yue-che and
other Central Asian nomads were famous in India as horse-
breeders. The Kamboja horse imported from the north-
west was known to be the best. The sea-route connecting
Western India with the Graeco-Roman world was being
frequently used by the Greek sailors and the wealth of the
Roman Empire (Ta-ts'in} was soon becoming proverbial.
Southern India was famous for its elephants. The Chinese
Empire in the East with its vast agglomeration of human
races was known for its general prosperity. The compiler
of the She eul yeu king must have belonged to Kashmir or
at any rate to North-Western India. ;

A similar information which a Chinese traveller named
K’ang-t’ai picked up in Further India (Fu-nan) from Indian
sources, in the middle of the third century A.D. (Pelliot,
BEFEO., Ill, 275-276)}—"'It is said in the foreign countries
that there are three abundances under the sky: the
abundance of men in China, the abundance of gems
in Ta-ts’in, the abundance of horses in the Yue-che
country.”” He: had not either heard anything about the
abundance of elephants.in Southern India or attached
any special importance to it as elephants were equally
abundant in Further India. Hence it is the question,
of this abundance which ude) the unknown compiler of
the She eal yeu king while he was altering the old theory in
the light of things known to him. The idea of two abun-
dances at least continued to be proverbial in India for a
long time. ISanavarman, the Maukhari king of the 6th
century while carrying on military campaign in different
directions speaks of having defeated the Andhras “‘who had
thousands of. three-fold rutting elephants’ and the Silikas
who had “‘a cavalry of countless galloping horses’’ (Basak—
History of North-Eastern India, p, 111). The Silikas whom

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 2g

have belonged to the mass of Central Asian nomads settled
in the North-West of India. (Salika, Culika and Culika-
Paigaci—Journal of Letters, vol. xxi).

It may not be out of place to point out that the associa-
tion of Aégvapati with the North-West of India is very old.
The name Aévapati is associated in the Epics with two
countries in the North-West, Kekaya and Madra. An
Aévapati of Kaikeya is mentioned in the Satepatha Brahmana
and the Chadndogya Upanisad.. He was contemporaneous
with king Janaka of Mithila. The same name Aévapati,
is borne by the maternal uncle of Bharata (Ramayana H, 9.
22 ete.; H. C. Raychaudhuri, Political History of Ancient
India, 2nd ed., p. 36). In the Mahabhdrata the name is
associated with the Madra country. Dr. Raychaudhuri
has shown on the evidence available in the epics that the
two countries were contiguous,—Kekaya was between
Gandhara and the Beas and Madra, between the Beas and
the Travati. The city of Sakala belonged to the latter
country. It is stated in the Mahabhdrata (Vana, 292) that king
Agvapati of Madra was the father of Savitri. It is not likely
that in all these cases Aévapati has been used as a proper
name. King Salya of Madra fought on the side of the Kurus
in the Mahabharata war. When Karna assumed the control
of the Kuru army he was selected as his charioteer on
account of his special knowledge of horses. His know!edge
of horses it is said, was greater than that of Matali, the
charioteer of Indra. He knew the nature of horses
_ (aévahrdaya) well and was am expert in the treatment of the
horses (Mahabharata, Karna, 32, verses 60-61; 35, verses
4), Nakula, the fourth Pandava, who was a direct nephew
of Salya also knew the same art and by virtue of it assumed
the contro] of king Virat’s stable during one year of their
incognito life (Virat, Il, verse, 2); King Salya is described
in the Adiparva (107, verse 3) as Balhika-pungava, the
best man amongst the Balhikas.. The northern Punjab to
which Madra country belonged is also: called Bahika, pro-
bably a corrupt form of the same name Balhika, in the

30 P. C. BAGCHI

Mahdabhérata (Karna, 44) and the tribes living in that part of
the country are decried for their bad manners. The Central
Asian nomads had already come up to the Punjab before
the Mahabharata had passed through the final stage of its
development. .

Lastly two inscriptional evidences of a later period pro-
bably bear out the same association of Agvapati with the
Madra country in the Punjab. The first is the Udayagiri
Inscription of the Gupta Era 108 (426 A:D.) of the time of
Kumaragupta (F leet, Corpus, p. 258). It records the pious gift
of a Jaina teacher named Acarya Gogarman. He was the
son of the Aévapati, a soldier named Sanghila, who was
born “in the region of the north, the best of countries which
resembles the land of Northern Kurus (in beatitude)."” The
Northern Kuru country was compared only with the
Northern Madra country in ancient times. It therefore seems
that there is gan allusion to the Madra‘ country and its rulers
who bore the title of Agvapati. In the Haraha Inscription
of the sixth century the Maukhari kings. also claim descent
from Aévapati of the solar race. This, according to certain
scholars, suggests early relation of the Maukharis with the
Madras of the Punjab (Sen—Some Historical Aspects of the
Inscriptions of Bengal, p. 241).

. 195.

[eke -]

In the A-seng-k’i (asarhkheya) kalpa the Bodhisattva was
the king of a country. His father and mother died early.
He gave the kingdom to his younger brother. After giving
up the kingdom he travelled seeking to learn the law, (While
thus travelling) he saw from a distance a Brahmin” of the
K’iu-tan (Gautama) family. He then followed the Brahmin
to learn the law (from him). The Brahmin told the Bodhi-
sattva: ““Think of the royal dress on your body. You will
have to put on a dress made of matted hairs like that of
mine which I got from the Gautama family.” The Bodhi-
sattva then got a garment like that to cover his body and
thus became one of the Gautama family.

Then after purifying himself he entered the deep moun-
tainous forest and sat on the peak of a hill absorbed in the
meditation of the law. The Brahmin then said: “You
were a king. You were respected and you lived in happi-
ness. Now you will have to submit to pains.”

So in the summer he had to drink water and eat only
fruits and melons. In the winter he returned to the city
and at the cross roads begged for his food. Then he came
back underneath the tree to practise meditation with an
undisturbed mind. Once while the Bodhisattva, came back
to his country to beg for food the king of the country down
to his people could not recognise him. He had become a
small Gautama. The Bodhisattva stayed in the mangoe
(kan-ko) garden outside the city,. A vibara Aking-ebie) was
erected there. Inside it there was only one seat.

There were then five hundred notorious. thieves in that
country. They had stolen, the things of the royal oticer

soe mene pes eet Sao ene mon RN ty Re nt ewer et coe enema ered Se hte GM Ce BAY nae ie a oe BR We Le

and were running away. They were passing by the vihara
of the Bodhisattva. They then left their foot marks there
and also abandoned the (stolen) things on either side of the
vihara.

The next day the people came out in search of the
thieves and by following their foot marks came up to the
vihara of the Bodhisattva. They arrested the Bodhisattva
and questioned him for information on the notorious thieves.
They had committed theft many times. The punishment
was more than death, The king ordered the ministers to
give him an exemplary punishment, As the law in regard
to such men was to put them on the stake so the Bodhi-
sattva*also was put on the stake. His body was bleeding
and the blood was flowing down to the ground.

Maha-Gautama saw it with his heavenly eyes from his
place in the depth of the mountain. Then by using his
magical power (rddhipada) he came down flying through
the sky and asked the Bodhisattva: ‘“‘What sin have you
committed, my child, so that you are suffering such torture?
There is no boil (on your body) but you are still bearing the
pain of the poison in this way.» The Bodhisattva replied:
“The pain is external but the mind within is full of mercy.
I do not know what sin I have committed to be exposed
suddenly to such torture.” Maha-Gautama said : “You
have neither any son nor any disciple (lit, family). Who
will be your descendant? Who is to bear such kind of
pain patiently? The Bodhisattva answered: ‘‘Life is
momentary. Why do you speak of sons and grandsons?”’

At that time the king ordered his men on the left and the
. right to get a stone bow and arrow. On getting it the king
shot: at. the Bodhisattva and killed him. Maha-Gautama
was ‘much aggrieved and wept. He then took down the
dead body and buried it. He collected blood from the
mud both from. the. right side and the left and made them
into balls. He then returned to his monastery in the
mouniain, put the blood taken from the left side in a vessel
on the left side and that taken from the right side in a vessel
cs

on the right. Then Maha-Gautama said: “‘If it is true that
you were a great master of the law (tao-she) then the gods
of the heavens should make a man of the blood.” After
ten months the blood on the left side became a man and
that on the right side a woman. The first was called Sho
yi jen.

At the beginning of the Bhadrakalpa the Precious
Tathagata She-kia (Sakya) lived 5000000 years. The next.
twenty five kings each lived 3000000 years. Then the king
Wen-t’o-kie ( %BEUR ) lived 1000000 years. Then the Ksatriya
Che-kia-yue (Cakravarti) kings and the kings of the left
flank and those of the right flank all lived 100000 years
each. Since the time of the king called Kuan-hi (Harsa)
all kings lived 84000 years each. Guided by a bad thought
the Cakravarti (Che-kia-yue} king sacrificed an ox and for
causing this harm to life lest his Golden Wheel, got the
Silver Wheel and the mastery over the three heavens only.
He lived only 10000 years. The king Firm-Thought (Drdha-
citta) used armour and lived 5000 years only. He got the
Copper Wheel, ruled over two heavens and was the lord
of the West and the South only. After that the king Easy-
killing (Sukhaghna) lived 2500 years, got the Iron Wheel and
was the ruler of the Southern heaven only. The last king
had five princes who by causing harm to living beings
shortened their life to 1000 years. In old times there were
only nine kinds of pains from disease, cold, heat, ‘thirst,
hunger, birth, old age, sickness and death. Since the
Brahmins began to sacrifice living beings 404 kinds of diseases
originated.

From the time of king Sishhacitta man’s life was reduced
to 120 years. After king Simnhacitta there were 84 kings
beginning with Simhamati, all having short lives, In their
times human life was gradually reduced: to. es ae 50, 30,
20 and 10 years. + Dh

340 P. C. BAGCHI

Afterwards there was a king called Simhajiva-ratha who
was also called Suddhodana (lit. Suddha). He was the
father of the Bodhisattva. From the beginning up to the
end of the Bodhisativa’s life it is 84000 years. The king
Che-kia-yue (Cakravarti) was of the Gautama race, It was
a pure and perfect race.

The Bodhisattva was in the T’eu-shu (Tusita) heaven.
When he wished to descend on the earth he looked around
to find out the country where he could take his birth. He
said: ‘“‘It is the family of king Suddhodana where I can
incamate myself."’ There was then in the heaven a tree
called T’eu-tan (Devadaru). The Bechisattva however sat
under a different tree and was absorbed in thought. The
first tree then emitted a light which knew no change. At
that time a heavenly being asked: ““Why did the Bodhi-
sattva give up the first tree and come to sit under the other
tree?’ A devaputra understood the mind of the Bodhi.
sattva. He replied: ““Do you not know? The Bodhisattva
now wishes to go down to the Yen-feu-li (Jambudvipa) and is
looking around to see in which kingdom he would take
birth. He will be born in the family of Suddhedana.”’

_All the Gods then said: ‘“The Bodhisattva is now going
down to take birth on the earth. What shall we offer him?’
They then thought over it and said: “‘In the bright heaven
there are 404 and sundry other gems, each of them having
a (separate) name. There are also precious flowers. A
chariot can be made for him with them.” The White Ele-
phant named Yi-lo-man (Airavata), the Naga king, will
draw it. His hairs are whiter than the snowy mountains.
He has 33 heads. Each head has 7 trunks, each of which
contains a lake. In. each lake there are 7 Yu-po (utpala)
flowers. Upon each flower there is a beautiful gizl.”’

. The. Bodhisattva — came down riding on the precious
chariot along with- 84000 devaputras. The car was drawn
by the White Elephant. At that time the queen of king
Suddhodana had the dream of a white elephant. She was
taken by fright and spoke about it to the king.

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 35

[ WL ]

The father of the Bodhisattva was called Suddhodana.
His father (and three uncles) were four brothers. King
Suddhodana had two sons.—the elder was Si-ta (Sid-
dh&rtha), the younger Nan-t’o (Nanda). The name of the
Bodhisattva’s mother was Mo-ye (Maya). The name of
Nanda’s mother was Kiu-tan-mi (Gautami). The eldest
uncle of the Bodhisattva was Amrtodana. The latter had
two sons—the elder was named T’eu-ta (Devadatta) and the
younger A-nan (Ananda). The second (middle) uncle of the
Bodhisattva was called king Suklodana. He had two sons—
the elder was called She Mo-na (Sakya Mahanaman) and the

younger A-na-liu (Aniruddha). The name of the youngest -

uncle of the Bodhisattva was king Sukrodana. He had two
sons, the elder was called She-kia wang (Sakyaraja?) and
_ the younger She sha wang (?).

In the kingdom of Kia-wei-lo-yue (Kapilavastu) there
were 8 cities and 900,0000 houses. Devadatta was born
on the 7th day of the 4th month. Buddha was born on the
8th day of the 4th month, Buddha’s younger brother Nanda
on the 9th day of the 4th month and Ananda on the 10th
day of the 4th month. The height of Devadatta’s body
was 15 ft. 4 inches that of Buddha’s body 16 ft., that of
Nanda’s body 15 ft. 4 inches, that of Ananda’s body 15 ft.
3 inches and that of the body of persons belonging to the
Sho-yi family 14 ft. The height. of the bow of other people
in the country was 13 ft.

The relatives of the Bodhisattva lived 800 li outside the.

city. The Gautama clan-was a small ruling clan ruling
over 1000000 houses. They were also called kings of
100000 (laksapati), The family of the. Bodhisattva’s wife
was also called Gautama. The chief of the Sho-yi family
was Shuei-kuang (Jalaprabha). His wife’s mother was named

Yue-niu (Candrakumari). She belonged to a city ‘near the .

frontier. The time when the girl was born the sun had
neatly set. But inside the. house - everything was bright. So
the girl was. given the name Kiu-yi- (Gopi) which means

36 P. C. BAGCHI

“Bright Girl’ (Ming-niu). Gopi was the first wife of the
Prince. Her father was the Elder Jalaprabha. The second
wife of the Prince gave birth to Lo-yu (Rahula). She was
called Ye-wei-t’an (Yaéodhara). Her father was the Elder
Ye-she (Yaga). His third wife was Lu-yi (Mrgaja). Her
father was the Elder She (Sakya). So the Prince had three
wives. His royal father had got built for him three palaces
suitable for three seasons. There were 20000 dancing girls
in’ each of the palaces. In the three palaces there were in
all 60000 dancing girls. The Prince was to be a Che-kia-yue
(Cakravarti) king and hence 60000 dancing girls were placed
in his palace.

Buddha left the house in his 29th year. He attained
the Bodhi (tao) in his 35th year. From the 8th day of the
4th month till the 15th day of the 7th month he remained
seated under the tree. This was the first year.

In the second year he preached the law to A-jo-kiu
(Ajfiata Kaundinya) and his other friends in the Deer Park.
He then explained the law to Pi-p’o-tan and others. He
then preached the law to 17 men, Kia-che-lo and others. He
also explained the law to the Elder Ta-tsai (Mahabala ?),
Eul-tsai-nien (Dvi-bala-citta 2), Yiu-po-yi (Upaka) and Cheng-
nien (Samyak-smrti), the Ni-kien (Nirgrantha). Later on he
spoke the law to 42 men including Ti-ho-kie-lo-fo (Dipara-
kara-Buddha).

In the third year he preached ne law to three HP ecinles
of Kia-ye (Kagyapa) and to a community of 1000 Bhikgus,
In the fourth year he preached the law to the Nagas,
Pretas and Gesii-eode: on the Siangt’eu (Gajagirsa)
mountain, ; :

In the fifth. year he Heche’ the law to Sse-ho-mei in the
Bamboo grove. In the fifth year while he was on his way
to Sho-wei (Srdvasti) the Brahmin She-li-fo (Sariputra} was
waiting under a tree with 125 disciples. At that time Mu-
lien (Maudgalyayana) who was a general in the country of

TWELVE YEARS OF WANDERING LIFE OF BUDDHA 37

Mi-yi-lo (Mithila 2) while passing by that way saw Sariputra
waiting under the tree. He asked Sariputra why he was
waiting there. Sariputra replied: “I wish to learn the law
(tao). Maudgalyayana replied: “I shall be also your
companion.”” So saying he sent away 100 soldiers. Only
125 remained with him. Thus the two had with them
altogether 250 men.

While Sariputra was entering the city for fen-wei (pinda-
pata) he met with a disciple of Buddha, the Bhikgu Ma-she
(Agvajit). Sariputra enquired from him who was his reli-
gious teacher, as his dress was not the same (as his). The
Bhiksu Aévajit replied: “‘I am the disciple of Buddha.”
Sariputra asked: “What law does Buddha speak?’
Aévajit replied: ‘‘According to Buddha all dharma has a
cause. (He also speaks on) its destruction, on the extinction
of all pains and on nirvana.”” When Sariputra received
from him the law of Siu-t’o-yuan (Srotapanna) he felt very
happy, came back’ to Maudgalydyana and said: ‘““There is
a godly man in the world.”” Maudgalydyana asked: ““Who
has spoken the law to you?’ Sariputra then gave him the
whole account. Maudgalyayana then wanted to get the law
of Srotapanna. The two men then went to Buddha with the
disciple of Buddha.

Note: The last paragraph placed within square brackets
is found in the quotation in the King lia yi siang to which
we have already referred, The preceding paragraph is found
in the She eul yeu king as well as in the said quotation of
the King liu yi siang. There is some difference between the
two texts in regard to this paragraph : instead of 330 the
King lia has 2320, instead of ‘42 kinds of incense”
the King liu gives “43 kinds .........’ and for Na-ngo
the King lia gives Na-p’o.

The five geographical names See-li Kia-lo, Sho-ve and
Na-ngo (var. Na-p’o) have been commented on by Pref. °
Lévi (Pour Phistoire du Ramayana, p. 83). He refers to the
Fan fan yu, a Chinese compilation of the 6th century, in
which these names have been explained after a Siitra which
is now lost. According to it Kia-lo means black (Kala),
Pu-lo, “‘city”’ (Pura) and Sho-ye, “‘victory’’ (Jaya), Of these
Prof, Lévi has suggested a definite identification only for one
—Sho-ye.. He would identify it with Java. But the transla-
tion of the name as “victory’’ (Jaya) suggests a connection
of the name not with, Java but with Srivijaya. In fact. M.
Ferrand has proposed this identification (L’Empire Surnatra-
nais de Srivijaya, - tage, p. 154), The only difficulty in
accepting it lies i in a the fact that there is no other record to

Canes aW

- prove the existence of the name as early as the 3rd century
A.D. when the She eul yeu king was translated for the first
time. Whatever may be the definite identification it is
quite clear that Sho-ye must be located in the Java-Sumatra
group. Amongst the other names Sse-li *Sie-lji is certainly
an old transcription of a name like Siha-dip (Sirnhala-dvipa).
This value of li is also found in Yen-feu-li (Jambudvipa).
The explanation of the two names Kia-lo and Pu-lo in the
Fan jan yu as ‘black’? (Kala) and ‘“‘city”’ (pura) seems to be
fanciful. Kia-lo, on the contrary, reminds us of later Kia-lo-
hi (Grahi). Pu-lo restored as Pura would be meaningless as
the name of an island. It may be the Indonesian word Pulo-
Pulay which means ‘island’ and is used with names of differ-
ent islands (cf. Pulo Condore, Pulo Penang etc.). Na-ngo
seems to be the correct name and not Na-p’o. It may be res-
tored as Nagna—the island of the naked people. Such a
name is given by Yi-tsing to the Nicobar Isles (Records,

p. 68).

The Rise of Sukhodaya
‘By Dr. R. C, Mayumpar

The origin of the Thai Kingdom of Sukhodaya is in-
volved in obscurity. Some light is thrown on this by an
inscription found at Sukhodaya. The relevant passage is,
however, very mutilated, and does not make any complete
sense. Coedés, who first brought out its historical impor-
tance, has drawn sonte conclusions which are now gene-
rally accepted. It. appears that a Kambuja general was
sent against two Thai chiefs named Phd Khun Bang Klang
Thao and Phd Khun Pha Muang, chief of Muang Rat. The
former had taken possession of Sajjandlaya and the latter
with his army came to his aid. The Kambuja army which
occupied Sukhodaya, or at least barred access to it, was
defeated and the victorious Thai Chief Pho Khun Pha
Muang then entered Sukhodaya and entrusted its govern-
ment to Phd Khun Bang Klang Thao. The latter, how-
ever, we are told, could not enter the city out of respect
(or fear, it is not clear which) for his ally. So the former
removed his army, and when Bang Klang Thao entered
Sukhodaya; formally consecrated him to the throne of
Sukhodaya under the name of Sri Indrapatindraditya with
the title Kamraten Afi Pha Muang, which had been con-
ferred on him by the king of Kambuja. The passage of
the‘inscription which relates this, although somewhat cryp-
tic, seems to convey. that Pho Khun Pha Muang, who had

married the daughter of the king of Kambuja, was a vassal

chief and had’ received from him formal investiture as
such. By: his defeat. of the “‘audacious Khom’’ i.e., the
Kambuja general sent. to oppose him, and triumphal.-entry
into - Sukhodaya, Pha Muang regarded himself as the suze-
rain, and conferred, in his turn, on his ally, the position
and titles he had_ himself received from the suzerain king
of Kambuja. Thus we may trace in this incident the
virtual liberation of N. Siam from the yoke of Kambuja. But

_ the old linkswere not altogether broken, for the old Kambuja

titles were borne by the new king and his successors. .

THE RISE OF SUKHODAYA 45

Interest naturally centres around Phd Khun Pha Muang
who was thus instrumental in liberating Siam from Kambuja
suzerainty. Coedés, who brought out the above facts, has not,
unfortunately, pursued this question any further, but there
are certain points of great interest which merit a fuller dis-
cussion. According to the inscription, Pha Muang had
married the daughter of the king of Kambuja, and obtained
the sacred sword, the honorific title named Sri Indrapati-
ndraditya and a fermal investiture from him. All these
point to his identity with king Srindravarman of Kambuja,
who had married the daughter of king Jayavarman VIII
of Kambuja. Now Cheu Ta-Kuan, who accompanied the
Chinese embassy to the court of Srindravarman in 1296 A.D.
gives us the following account of this king ““The new king
is the son-in-law of the old. He had adopted a military
career. His father-in-law loved his daughter who stole the
golden sword (of the king) and took it to her husband.
The son, thus deprived of succession, plotted to raise an
army. The new king came to know of it, cut off the fingers
of his feet and shut him up ina dark chamber.’ The

2 The text of the Ins. may be Hiterally translated as follows:
“Formerly the divine king of Sti Sodharapura had given to Phd Khun
Pha Muang his daughter named. Nang Sikharamahadevi, the sacred
sword Jayasri and an honorific title like his own. Phéd Khun Bang
Klang Thao recewved the name Sri Indrapatindraditya because Pho
Khun Pha Muang took his own. name for giving it, in his turn, to
his friend.” Ccedés has poirited out that in modern Siamese and
Cambodian documents Sti Sodharapura appeais as an element in the
literary designation of the capital of Cambodia (BEFEO., XII. VI
p. 9; XVIII, 9, p. 24). Cxedés formerly restored the name as Siridbara
or Siri Sundara (Ibid... But he now (JA., 1920, Pp. 241) proposes to
take it as a corruption of -YaSodharapura, the name of the old Kambuja
capital, because he finds in a modern Cambodian state paper the name
of the capital written: as-‘ entre Sri Yasodhara brak Viele:
nagara Indraprastha Rastha femal

3 BEFEO., Vol. I, ‘p. 176...

46 R. C. MAJUMDAR

account of Cheu Ta-Kuan is partly corroborated by a Kam-
buja inscription which says that Jayavarman VIII abdicated
the throne in favour of his son-in-law.* According to
the custom followed in Kambuja the prince who was
consecrated as heir-apparent with the title Sri Indrapati
or Indraditya would be called Srindravanaan on accession
to the throne.** Thus we have a remarkable coincidence,
both in name and the three special circumstances (marriage
of the king’s daughter and the possession of the sword,
indicating investiture as heir-apparent) between the Kam-
buja king Srindravarman and the chief Pha Muang.
Besides, the fact that this chief, although son-in-law of the
Kambuja king, was opposed by an ‘‘audacious Kambuja
general’ would be explained by the rivalry between
Srindravarman of Kambuja and his brother-in-law referred
to by Cheu Ta-Kuan. Such coincidences cannot be dis-
missed as casual and we are justified in presuming the
identity of the two. In that case we must hold that prince
Srindravarman was invested as regent or Viceroy over
Siam during the reign of his father-in-law, and in the
struggle for succession with his brother-in-law, which took
place during the reign of the ald king, he had the assistance
of the Thai chief whose services he rewarded by his appoint-
ment as vassal chief of Sukhodaya, nominally under his
-suzerainty. It was probably not long before the chief of
Sukhodaya became too powerful and challenged the
authority of Kambuja, and the ‘recent wars with the Sia-
mese which devastated the Angkor region’ as reported by
Cheu Ta-Kuan might refer to the civil war or to the later
stages of this war for liberation. In any case we are justi-
fied in presuming that the rise of Sukhodaya as an indepen-
dent kingdom was probably due to the civil war between
Siindravarman; the son-in-law of the king of Kambuja,
and his brother-in-law.

THE RISE OF SUKHODAYA 47

If this presumption be accepted we have to refer the
accession of Indraditya to the reign of Jayavarman VIII
who ascended the throne in 1243 A.D. or somewhat later.
This is in conflict with the current view that Indrdditya
founded the kingdom of Sukhodaya in 1218 AD. This
view, however, rests upon a highly speculative interpretation
of a passage in the Nagara Jum Ins. by P. Petithuguenin.”
He translates I]. 19-21 of the Ins. as follows: ‘The year
in which Phraya Maha Dharmaraja constructed (or com-
menced) the Phra Dhatu, the age of men was lowered
below 100 years. That was 139 years ago, and the year
of the reduction is really the year of Hare.’’ He then
observes: ‘‘If this phrase has any sense it appears to
convey that 139 years before 1279 i.e., in 1140 Saka (= 1218),
which was really a year of Hare,* under a king named
Phraya Maha Dharmaraja an important social revolution
took place, which could well be, as already remarked by
Lajonquiere, the date of accession of the first king of
Sukhodaya. It is not then Sri Siirya Phrah Maha Dharma-
rajadhiraja who reigned from 1276 to 1298 Saka, but one
of his predecessors more than a century ago, who is the
Phrah or Ba Thammarat of the tradition and who could
not be any other than Indraditya.”’

It is needless to point out that the above theory
about the accession of Indraditya in 1218 A.D. rests on a
very weak basis and cannot be taken seriously. The
earliest definite date in the chronology of Sukhodaya is
furnished by the Inscription of Rama Khamheng,’ accord-
ing to which this king, who was the third son of Indraditya,
and the third king of the dynasty, was on the throne bet-
ween 1283 and 1292 A.D. This would place the accession
of Indraditya some time about the middle of the third
century A.D. Now the Pali chronicle Jinakalamdlini pla-
ces the accession of Phra Ruang the founder of the dynasty

6 This is not correct. CE ibid., Pp. es |

48 R. C. MAJUMDAR

in 1256 A.D. Prince Damrong has suggested the identi-
fication of Phra Ruang and Indraditya and Coedés also
favours the same view." We may, therefore, provisionally,
accept 1256 A.D. as the date of accession of Indraditya,
though we shall not be justified in regarding it as an estab-
lished fact.

If we accept this date for Indraditya, and identify the
chief Ph& Muang with the future king of Kambuja named
Indravarman we have to reconstruct the political history
of the period somewhat differently than is done at present.
It would appear that either. the struggle referred to in the
Sukhodaya Inscription must have taken place long after
the accession of Indraditya or that the civil war in Kambuja
between the son and son-in-law of Jayavarman VIII must
have commenced at an early part of the reign of that king.
Both these views being opposed to the current ideas on
the subject, they may be examined a little more closely.

It is generally assumed that Indraditya began his poli-
tical carreer as chief of Sukhodaya. This, however, is not
borne out by any positive evidence. On the other hand
the Sukhodaya Inscription referred to above shows that
he was already the chief of the principality of Sajjanalaya
when he joined Pha Muang. Instances are not want-
ing when.a petty chief, who later becomes ruler of
an important kingdom, dates his accession from his first
coming to power. We may thus regard 1256 A.D. (or
any .other date that may be’ accepted en more positive
evidence) as the date when Indraditya first became a ruling
chief and not necessarily that of his conquest of Sukhodaya.

The perusual of the first part of Rama Khamheng’s Ins-
cription leaves the impression that Sukhodaya was nota
very important kingdom during the time of his father and
elder brother who preceded him, and its greatness and
importance really date from his time. We cannot rule out
altogether the possibility that. Indrapatindraditya who was
formally consecrated at Sukhodaya by the son-in-law of

8 BEFEO., Vol. XVII, pp. 43-44,
R. C. MAJUMDAR 49

the Kambuja king after the.defeat of the Kambuja general
was no other than Rama Khamheng himself, the name
Indrapatindraditya being composed of the name of his
benefactor (Indrabhipati) and his own grandfather Indra-
ditya. This is undoubtedly a mere hypothesis for the
present, but we cannot discard it simply because it does
not tally with the current views on the subject which are,
however, not based on any solid ground.

Rama Khamheng claims in his Inscription to have made
extensive conquests, and occupied territories belonging
to Kambuja. CheuTa-Kuan, writing of Kambuja in 1296
or 97 A.D. refers to the devastation of the country in the
recent wars with Siam. The Sukhodaya Inscription refers to
a fight between Kambuja general and the son-in-law of the
Kambuja king allied with a Thai Chief of Siam. All these
may refer to the different episodes in the struggle between
the son and son-in-law of the Kambuja king Jayavarman
VIll. This civil war then must have taken place sometime
before the ent] of the reign of this king in 1295 or 1296 A.D.
This seems to follow from the statement in the Manga-
lartha Temple Inscription that Jayavarman VIII abdicated
in favour of his son-in-law. But although this may be
justly regarded as a very weak argument against the obvi-
ous inference from CheuTa-Kuan’s statement, quoted
above, it is to be noted that we cannot reject the idea of
a civil war taking place long before the end of Jayavarman’s
reign without upsetting some of the generally. accepted
views of historical events. For apart from all speculative
theories on the identification of Pha Muang, the broad
fact remains that he, a son-in-law of the ruling king of
Kambuja, fought with a Kambuja general near Sukhodaya.
Although this cannot be precisely dated it could hardly have
taken place in 1295 or 1296 A.D. when king Rama Kham-
heng must have, according to the generally accepted view

9 The Mangalartha Temple Ins. refers’ to Stindravarman as

50 THE RISE OF SUKHODAYA

based on Sukhodaya Inscription, thoroughly established
his power over Sukhodaya and an extensive region round
it, and we can hardly think of a Kambuja prince defeating
a Kambuja general and consecrating an allied chief as
ruler over Sukhodaya.*® On the other hand it is difficult
to explain away the incident by referring it to the reign
of any other king of Kambuja. For, as we have seen above
there are no reasonable grounds to place the foundation
of Sukhodaya by Indraditya before 1243 A.D. when Jaya-
varman VIII ascended the throne, and the fight between
the Kambuja general and the son-in-law of Kambuja king,
referred to in the Sukhodaya Inscription, can only refer
to a civil war in his reign.

In case our theory is right that this struggle was caused
by the rivalry between Srindravarman and his brother-in-
law over the succession to the throne, we can hardly place
it long before 1275 A.D., and possibly the date is later.
For in the Bantei Srei Inscription of Srindravarman the
earth is congratulated on its deliverance, by a young king,
from the thorns and brambles which had grown up during
the reign of an old king.” This shows that Srindravarman
was a young man when he ascended the throne in 1295
or 1296 A.D. It is hardly likely therefore that he would
have been eid enough | to contest the throne long before
c. 1275 A.D.. !

The reference to: the ties and brambles during the
reign of the: old king Jayavarman VIII probably reflects
the true condition of things, and in the light of what has
been suggested above. we may provisionally reconstruct
the history of the period: as follows :—

Jayavarman VIH, in his old age, nominated Srindra-
varman, his ala ap ta: his successor and appointed him

10 Of course we can 1 explain this on the basis of the theory —

as governor over western provinces including Siam. His
son thereupon took up arms to defend his right. Thus
ensued a civil war in course of which battles were fought
in Siam. The conquest of the Thai Kingdom of Nan Chao
by Kublai Khan led to a movement of the warlike Thais
towards the south, and Srindravarman enlisted their support
by offering large rewards and concessions. In particular,
he won over a Thai Chief (either Indraditya or Rama Kham-
heng) by consecrating him as king of Sukhodaya and offer-
ing him virtual independece and suzerainty over Siam.
With their help he defeated his brother-in-law and impri-
soned him, but did not ascend the throne till some years
later when the old king abdicated in his favour. The
palace-intrigues and the general insecurity of the times
are indicated by the fact that Srindravarman, even after
he became king, seldom ventured to come out in public

and was clad, on those rare occasions, by an iron coat

of mail, to guard himself from assassins. The civil war led to
political troubles at home and abroad, but its most impor-
tant effect was the foundation of a strong Thai kingdom
in Siam with its capital at Sukhodaya.

The date of accession of Jayavarman Il
By Dr. R. C. Mayumpar

The accession of Jayavarman II, the king of Kambuja,
in 724 Saka (=802 A.D.) was regarded as a fixed point in
Kambuja chronology till Coedés propounded a new theory
in 1928. He discussed the question in connection with
an inscription in the temple of Lobok Srot which was
issued in 703 Saka during the reign of a king Jayavarman,
-_ and observed as follows: ‘‘When I first edited the inscrip-
tion (BEFEO., V, p. 419) Jayavarman Il was believed to
have reigned till 791 S. and it was therefore impossible
to attribute this inscription to him without assigning him
a reign of 90 years and a longevity of at least 110 years;
and I provisionally numbered this king as Jayavarman
I (bis). But since according to the new chronology | have
established at the beginning of this note, Jayavarman Il
died in 776 S$. it is not at all impossible that it was
he who had founded the temple of Lobok Srot, perhaps
immediately after his return from Java and at the beginning
of his reign at Indrapur. But this is merely a hypothesis
to which | draw attention in passing. If it comes to be
verified, it will furnish a valuable chronological data
and prove that Jayavarman II returned from Java before
781 A.D"?

Regarding the prevalent opinion about the date of
Jayavarman’s accession he remarks elsewhere in the same
article that the reign of Jayavarman II did not really
commence in 724 S. as is generally held, but that date marks
the foundation of his capital on Mt. Mahendra.’

In view of the great scholarship of M. Coedés and his
unrivalled knowledge of Kambuja history, any hypothesis

1 BEFEO., Vol. XXVIIL, fe 11g. 2 Ibid., p. 117.
R. C. MAJUMDAR 53

propounded by him is likely to meet general acceptance.
This alone can explain the readiness with which some
scholars have accepted the new theory without any further
examination. For there seems to be hardly any valid
ground—and none has been urged by Ccoedés—for taking
724 S. as the date of the foundation of the capital on
Mahendraparvata. Following the usual tradition in Kambuja
epigraphy, the authors of several inscriptions have referred
to the date of commencement of Jayavarman’s reign, and
no reason has been shown why that date should be asso-
ciated with a particular incident in the reign of Jayavarman
ll, and not regarded, as in all other cases, as the date of
his accession. It is true that the reference to Mahendra-
parvata is found in some of these verses, as for example.
‘* Asid = Goaridher = urvvim vahan= ved-ardha-
bhiidharaih |
Raja Sri-Jayavarmm = eti Mahendra-adri-
krt-aspadah ||°

Here the expression Mahendradri® is a qualifying epithet

‘of the king and it would be a far-fetched interpretation to

regard it as qualifying the date. But fortunately there are
verses in several other records which clearly refer .the
accession of Jayavarman II to 724 S. without any refer-
ence whatsoever to his capital on Mahendraparvata.* The
most interesting evidence about the -correct interpretation
of this verse is, however, furnished by Prea Kev Ins.” It

54 THE DATE OF ACCESSION OF JAYAVARMAN II

contains two verses denoting the commencement of the
reigns of two kings of Kambuja which run as follows:

(a) “‘Asid= Sr Sergadarmm= eti Veda-dvi-bila-
rajya- bhak |

(b) Asid-Kamvuja-rdjendro. Veda-dvi-naga-

rdjya-bhak ||

‘The aries of the two expressions, in the same inscrip-
tion, leaves no doubt that in both cases the date was meant
to be that of the accession of the king. There is no doubt
that the second verse quoted above refers to Jayavarman II
and as such we must regard 724 as the date -of his accession.

So, the significance of the date 724 is clear. As regards
Coedés’ theory that the king Jayavarman of Lobok Srot Ins.,
dated 703 S., was identical with Jayavarman Il, it has been
demolished, as Coedés was the first to admit®, by the dis-
covery of another inscription, dated 692 Saka (=770A.D.),
at Prah That Prah Srei, of the reign of Jayavarman.
For it is now more reasonable to identify the two kings
mentioned in these- records, and obviously he cannot be
identified with Jayavarman II whose reign in that case would
cover the period 770-854 A.D.

There is thus. no reason whatsoever to disregard the
clear statement in the epigraphic records that Jayavarman
Il came to the throne in 724 Saka _(=802 A.D.). It appears
that Coedés himself never definitely abandoned this old
view in favour of his new hypothesis, for even long after
it was propounded he gave the date of Jayavarman Il as
802-854 A.D.’ And so does Parmentier. But unfortu-
nately other scholars were less cautious and accepted
Coedés’ theory asa settled fact. Thus Dr. B. R. Chatterji’,

-7 BEFEO., Vol. XXXIV, p. gar.

8 Ibid., Vol. XXXV, p. 65.

P. Stern*® and P. Dupont” have accepted 724 S. as the
date of the foundation of Mahendraparvata, and placed the
accession of Jayavarman I] towards the end of the eighth
century A.D. even long after Dr. Ccedés, who originally
propounded these views, had given them up. In any case
the accession of Jayavarman II must be placed in 802 A.D.

854 A.D.” gth is obviously a misprint for 8th. He fully accepts

Coedés’ theory on p. 145 (last three lines).

(BEFEO., Vol. XXXVI, pp. 416, 630) but sometimes takes it as the

Progress of Greater Indian Research during
the last twenty-five years (1917-42)
—A Supplement”

Preface

From early times a shallow generalization has often
drawn the picture of India as standing aloof from the currents
of the world’s history. This view seems to find its support in
the remarkable physical features of the land and not less,
in the unique type of its civilization. With its frontiers
girt round by impassable mountains and forests as well as
the circling seas, nature herself appears to have doomed
India toa life of splendid isolation. India’s remarkable
institution of caste as well as its distinctive systems of
religion and philosophy would seem further to have formed
an insurmountable barrier between its people and those
of the outside world. And yet atthe present moment
itis buta historical truism to assert that never in all the
centuries of its past existence our country has ceased to
maintain active contact by land as well as by sea with
countries and peoples beyond its frontiers. This contact,
it must further be noted, was not confined to the exchange
of material goods, but extended also to the domain of ideas.

In this grand and ceaseless process of contact with
neighbouring lands, India’s role has not been.that of a
mere passive recipient. More and more the unimpeachable
evidence of history is proving the profound influence
exercised by her all-pervasive culture upon outside lands,
specially those of South-Eastern and Eastern Asia. Thus Sir
John Marshall, who cannot certainly be accused of ex-
aggerating Indian influence, after referring in a recent
pronouncement to ‘the amazingly vital and flexible character
of Indian Art’ and the common capacity of Indian and

Greek Art ‘to adapt themselves to suit the needs of every
country, race and religion with which they came into
contact’, writes as follows:—‘‘To know Indian Art in India
alone, is to know but half its story. To apprehend it to the
full, we must follow it in the wake of Buddhism, to Central
Asia, China and Japan; we. must watch it assuming new
forms and breaking into new beauties as it spreads over
Tibet and Burma and Siam; we must gaze in awe at the
unexampled grandeur of its creations in Cambodia and
Java. In each of these countries, Indian Art encounters a
different racial genius, a different local environment, and
under their modifying influence it takes on a different garb’’.
(Foreword to Reginald Le May, Buddhist Art in Siam,
Cambridge, 1938). What is true of art, is true of other
branches of civilization as well. As a brilliant French
writer has recently observed:—‘‘In the high plateau of
Eastern Iran, in the oases of Serindia, in the arid wastes .
of Tibet, Mongolia and Manchuria, in the ancient civilised
lands of China and Japan, im the lands of the primitive
Mons and Khmers and other tribes in Indo-China, in the
countries of the Malayo-Polynesians, in Indonesia and
Malay, India left the indelible impress of her high culture
not only upon religion, but also upon art and literature, in
a word, all the higher things of the spirit? (Réné Grousset,
The Civilisations of the East, vol. Il, p. 276). Out of this
amazing expansion of India’s unique culture there roge and
flourished in the first millennium of the Christian era, to
quote the authoritative words of the French author just:
mentioned, ‘a Greater India politically as little organised
as Greater Greece, but morally equally homogeneous’.
But as Greater India has excelled in extent and duration
its Greek counterpart, so much has the recovery of its lost
history cost greater scholarly effort and enterprise. This
process of rediscovery of Greater India, slow and fitful at
the beginning, has taken larger and larger strides with the
march of time. In the following pages an attempt is made
to trace the extraordinary advance which Greater Indian -

8

58 U.N. GHOSHAL

research has achieved during the last quarter of a century.
This achievement, it will be seen, has been largely secured
by the organization of expedition and research under the aus-
pices of the various advanced Governments of the modern
world. Next to the Governments, the learned Societies of
various lands have co-operated in unearthing and inter-
preting the records of the past history of Greater India.

The cumulative labours of a host of explorers, archaeo-
logists, art-critics and historians of various lands, gather-
ing in momentum during the last quarter of a century,
have added a new and glorious chapter to the history of
our country. Inthe teeth of blind ignorance and narrow
prejudice, they have definitely established India’s claim
to rank among the great civilising nations of the world. To
quote the pertinent remarks of Sir Charles Eliot (Hinduism
and Buddhism, Vol. I, p. xii): —‘Scant justice is done
to India’s position in the world by those histories which
recount the exploits of her invaders and leave the
impression that her own people were a feeble dreamy
folk, sundered from the rest of mankind by their sea
and mountain frontiers. Such a picture takes no account
of the intellectual conquests of the Hindus. Even their
political conquests were not contemptible and are remark-
able for the distance, if not the extent, of the territories
occupied.......But such military or commercial invasions
are insignificant compared with the spread of Indian
thought.” As the eminent French savant Sylvain Lévi
writes (Abel Bergaigne et l’Indianisme jn Revue Blue, tome
45, 1890, tr. by Kalidas Nag in Modern Review, Dec.
1921):—‘From Persia to the Chinese Sea, from the icy
regions of Siberia to the islands of Java and Borneo, from
Oceania to Socotra, India has propagated her beliefs, her
genius, her tales and her civilization, She has left indelible
imprints on one-fourth of the human race in course of a
long succession of centuries. She has the right to reclaim in
universal history the rank that ignorance has refused her
for a long time and to hold her place amongst the great

s

nations summarising and symbolising the spirit of Huma-
nity.’ How the discovery of this grand truth is reacting
in the minds of India’s greatest sons is best expressed in
the pregnant words of Rabindranath Tagore (Foreword to
JGIS., vol. 1, No. 1, January 1934):—“To know my country
in truth one has to travel to that age, when she realised
her soul and thus transcended her physical boundaries,
when she revealed her being in a radiant magnanimity
which illumined the Eastern horizon, making her recog-
nised as their own by those in alien shores who were
awakened into asurprise of life ; and not now when she
has withdrawn herself within a narrow barrier of obscurity,
into a miserly pride of exclusiveness, into a poverty of

mind that dumbly revolves around itself in an unmean-

ing repetition of a part that has lost its light and has no
message to the pilgrims of the future.’’ It is to be earnestly
hoped that the amazingly rich record of progress in the
rediscovery of Greater India, that is revealed in these
pages, will usher in a period of active research carried
out by her own sons ina field they have sadly neglected
so far. -

Central Asian Sanskrit Texts in Brahmi Script.
(SKPAW., XLIV. 1904). A Turkish fragment in
Brahmi was afterwards published along with a
2a glossary of Turkish words by H. W. Bailey
a P. 17. line 8: After ‘surprisingly’ add.
i ‘The Tibetan fragments of the Rama story have
since been investigated by M. Lalou (J. A., 1936)’.
P. 17. line 34: After Peiping 1930-31 add:

‘A brief but useful, survey of Indian cultural influ-
ences in Central Asia, Tibet, China, Further India
and Malayasia has since been given by F. W. Thomas
in his Calcutta University Lectures under the title
Indianism and its Expansion, Calcutta 1942. In the
course of this work the author pays a well-deserved
tribute to the work of Japanese scholars, of whom he
says (op. cit. p. 96):—‘In the study of ancient Indian
originals no other country has produced scholars
combining to the same extent a facility in dealing
with the sources and the painstaking scholarly
method’. .

P. 19. line 12: After Calcutta 1931 add:

“The authorship of the Nyayapravesa is still dis-
puted between Dinnaga and his pupil Sankara-
svamin. For a good summary of this discussion
see the Introduction, pp. virxiii to the Nydya-
pravesa, Pt. I Sanskrit text with commentaries
critically edited by A. B. Dhruva (GOS. No.
XXXVIM, *Baroda, 1930). The author’s tentative
conclusion is that ‘the Nydyapravega is a work
composed by Sankarasvamin to facilitate entrance

PROGRESS OF GREATER INDIAN RESEARCH &9

into the Nydyadudra (‘the Gate of Logic’) which
is a work of his master Dinnaga’. Alambanapariksa
of Dianaga has recently been edited in its restored
Sanskrit form with an accompanying English tran-
slation and copious extracts from Dharmapala’s com~
mentary by N. Aiyaswami Sastri. (Adyar Library,
Madras 1942). To this list we have to add the
publication of the text and translation (in German)
of Agvaghosa’s Buddhacarita by Freiderich Weller;
Leipzig 1926. This work consists of two parts, Part I,
containing the text and translation of cantos 1-8
and Part II those of cantos 9-17.’

P19 line 25: After Part Hl, 1932, add:

bution to the Bibliography of Tibet (BSOS., VILL,

graphical interest are the frescoes of tantric deities

adorn the walls of some of these temples.’

P. 21 line 28: After Tibetan Libraries add:

‘The Bihar & Orissa. Research Society has since
published a series of works under the title Sanskrit
Texts from Tibet. Among these we may specially
mention the Adhyardhasataka[‘Hymn ofone hundred

70 U. N. GHOSHAL

and fifty (verses)] by Matrceta, edited with preface
and two appendices by Rahula Sankrityayana. This
edition is based upon Sanskrit texts recovered by the
author from Tibetan monastic libraries as well as the
Tibetan and Chinese versions and Hoernle’s edition
of the Central Asian Manuscript Fragments in the
work Manuscript Remains of Buddhist Literature
found in Eastern Turkestan. Another notable
work ot the same series is the Pramdnavdritika

truction in. 1908. It started in the same year an
important Bulletin to receive and examine all commu-
nications relating to the conservation of archaeological
monuments. . in» Indo-China. In actual practice the
activities of the school extended far beyond its narrow

programme. The successive numbers of its Bulletin
contained inventories of Indo-Chinese sculptures
existing in public and private collections within
and outside France, such as the Catalogue des pieces
originales de sculpiure khmere conservees au Musée
indo-chinois du Trocadero et au Musée Guimet by
George Ccedés (BCAI., 1910), and the Catalogue des
sculptures Cames et Khmeres du Musée royal d’ethno-
graphie d Berlin by H. Sténner (BCAI., 1912).
Among other topics treated in the Bulletin were
various questions of Indo-Chinese archaeology and
epigraphy. Such were Les bas reliefs de Baphuon
by Louis Finot (BCAI., 1910), Les bas-reliefs d'Ang-
kor Vat by George Coedés (BCAI., 1911) and Les
inscriptions du Bayon by George Coedés, (BCAI.,
1913). In the same Journal (BCAI., 1911) Coedés
published his Index Alphabetique pour le Cambodge
de M. Aymonier. The Commission finally pub-
lished a number of monographs such as Le Bayon
d’Angkor Thom, Bas-reliefs publies par les soins de
la commission Archéologique de I’ Indo-chine, (2 vols.

Paris, 1910-13) and Les Monuments du Cambodge,

sought from time to time to communicate its activi-
ties. In 1917 Emile Senart presented his report on
the activities of the School to the famous Academy
of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in Paris. His exam-
ple was followed successively by H. Cordier who
submitted two Reports covering the period from
1918 to 1920, by L. Finot who presented his Report
for the years 1920 to 1926 and by A. Foucher who
did the same for the period 1926 to 1930. Mean-
while Finot published (BEFEO,, 1921) a complete
summary of the activities of the School from its origin

to 1920. The school, which celebrated its twenty-fifth

anniversary by. publishing two volumes of Etudes

Amaravati Sculptures in the Madras Government
Museum: By C. Sivaramamurti, M.A., (Bulletin of the
Madras Government Museum), Madras 1942. pp. xviii+ 376
and 55 Plates. Government Press, Madras, Rs.: 14/8.*

Amaravati, situated on the south bank of the Krishna
river in the Guntur district of the Madras Presidency, was
one of the great cities of India in the first two centuries before
Christ and the centuries immediately following. Its glory was
the magnificent Buddhist stiipa with a drum adorned with
two tiers of casing slabs in bluish marble, the whole structure
being enclosed by an exquisitely carved railing in the same
material which was nearly six hundred feet in circumference
and thirteen or fourteen feet in height. ‘It has been estimated
that the railing alone provided a superficial area of 17,000
square feet covered with delicate reliefs, while the stdpa
itself, all the lower part of which was cased in carved stone,
had a diameter of 162 feet’. (A. K. Coomaraswamy, History
of Indian and Indonesian Art, p. 70). Revered as the principal
seat of one of the ancient Buddhist schools (the caityakas
of the Mahasanghika sect), the stiipa received succeésive
additions at the hands of pious Alevotees.for a period of four
or five centuries (2nd century B.C. to c. 250 A.D.). In later
times it shared in the general neglect of Buddhist monuments
which was the index of the decay of the religion of the
Buddha in its homeland, Re-discovered by Col. Colin
Mackenzie in 1797, it has undergone more or less unsystematic
excavations for nearly a century, presenting before the year
1880, in the forceful language of M. Foucher (L’ Art Gréco-
Bouddhique du ‘Gandhara, tome II, p. 613), ‘a déplorable
odyssée des débris de’ ce merveilleux édifice’. Out of the
group of Amaravati marbles which it was possible to save
from destruction, an. important collection found its way,
like the famous Elgin marbles of the Parthenon, into the

- British Museum in London. Another valuable collection was
deposited in the Madras Museum, while a few sculptures
were sent to the Indian Museum in Calcutta.

To Dr. James Burgess of the Archaeological’ Survey of
India, who was entrusted with the scientific excavation of
the monument in 188], we owe the first important monograph
on the subject. It was published in 1887 under the title The
Buddhist Stapas of Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta. Since then
considerable additions have been made to our knowledge of
the famous stiipa by the discovery of fresh sculptures and
revised interpretations of older ones as well as the decipher-
ment of the inscriptions. In the present well-written mono-
graph the author has utilised the researches of previous
scholars (including the valuable notes of Mr. T. N. Rama-
chandran) as well as his own intensive studies to produce
an admirably comprehensive and up-to-date description of
the sculptures of the Madras Museum collection.. While it is
much to be regretted that he had no opportunities of complet-
ing his study by utilising the British Museum or even the
Calcutta Museum collections, we are thankful to him for
providing us with something more than a mere descriptive
catalogue of the sculptures and inventory of the inscriptions.
For he has enriched his account within his compass with a
short, but valuable, historical introduction, with an excellent
survey of the art, iconography and symbolism of the
monument, and last but not least, with a vivid and complete
picture of the culture and civilisation of the period accom-
panied with illustrative drawings of the sculptures and
copious references from Brahmanical’ and Buddhist literature.

A good bibliography, five valuable appendices (including ©

indices cf personal and geographical names and a glossary
of words occurring in the inscriptions), a general index and
fifty-ve plates with short explanatory notes complete this
fine monograph.

We propose to make a few’ Pe ae Following the autho-

rity of Burgess, the author identifies (p.3) Hiuen Tsang’s |

with Waiters) with Amaravati, forgetting Watters’ criticism
fOn Yuan Chwang, Vol. Hl, p. 218) to the effect that Hiuen
Tsang is completely silent about the existence of the stépa
in that area. The author’s further sugestion (p.4) that -the
original stiipa of Amaravati was built by Agoka rests on the
flimsiest grounds, while it is significant that not even the
tradition of such a construction was known to the industrious
Hiuen Tsang at the time of his visit in the 7th century.

The writer justifies (p. l6ff.) his chronological division of.
the Amardvati sculptures into four periods, viz. c. 200-100
B.C., c. 100 A.D., c. 150 A.D. and c. 200-250 A.D., which is
based on the style of the sculptures and palaeography of the
inscriptions, by an elaborate comparison of motifs and techni-
que from the earliest to the latest times. In this connection we
are presented with a useful comparative “‘table of early
Indian sculptural periods’’ tracing the minute changes in
dress and ornament, in pose and motifs, in human and other
forms, for nearly a millennium, from the sculpture of Bharhut,
Ajanta Cave X, Amaravati I and Safichi (2nd. cent. B.C.)
to those of the Pallava monuments (7th-8th centuries A. D.) It
must, however, be remembered that the art of Safichi itself
passed. through a long course of development and decay. In
the sculptures of the Second and Third stiipas (excepting the
gateway and the ground balustrade of the latter) as well as
the ground balustrade and stone casing of the Great Stipa
(2nd cent. B.C.} the early indigenous school retains much of
its primitive character. But. the school reaches its climax in
the reliefs of the four gateways of the Great Stipa and the
single gateway of the’ Third stapa (c. 50 B.C.). Further
“developments may be traced in the detached images of the
4th and 5th centuries AD. as well as those of the 6th and
7th centuries. The group of structures on the eastern terrace
of the Safichi Hill belonging to the late mediaeval period
mark the last: stage in the development of the local art. (On
_ the above, see. Sir ‘John. Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi,
pp. 11-25). Evidently the author, in drawing up his compa-
rative table, has ignored all but the first phase of the Safici art.

NOTICES OF BOOKS 97

Equally regrettable is the author’s complete omission to
illustrate the interesting changes to which he draws attention,
with appropriate drawings. .

In connecting (p. 44). ‘the art of such distant places as
Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta, Bharhut and Sanchi, Ajanta
and Bagh and beyond the seas at Borabudur’ (sic !}, by
‘common heredity’ with ‘the great Imperial art of the
Mauryas’ the author -ignors the divison: of Maurya art
into the official or court art of Agoka’s reign, which according
to most authorities was more or less of an exotic character,
and the art of the Early Indian School which was represented
at Bharhut and Safichi. It is also to be regretted that the
author has failed to consider the views of M. Foucher
(op. cit., pp. 613-618) regarding the influence of the Gandhara
School upon the later art of Amaravati. The section on
iconography and symbolism (a more appropriate title would
have been ‘representations of Buddha, of demi-gods and of
real and mythical animals’) of the monument is good so
far as it goes. But the author has unfortunately failed to refer
to the valuable contributions made on the subject by Foucher
(op. cit.) and Vogel, (Ganga et Yamund dans I’ iconographic —
Brahmanique, Etudes Asiatiques, 1925 and Le Makara dans
la sculpture de I’Inde, Revue des Arts Asiatiques, Paris
1930), If he had referred to Vogel’s monograph last-named,
he would have’ found: (op. cit., p. 94) the ancestry of
the Makara-motif to be traced beyond Bharhut and Amara-
vati to the crocodile figures on the fagade of the Lomasa
Rishi Cave at the Barabar Hills near Gaya.

The author’s description of the various aspects of Indian
life in the light of the. Amaravati sculptures of the third period
which is illustrated with appropriate drawings and explained
in the light of literary references is accurate and comprehen-
sive. But he might have referred to the important paper of
Dr. Moti Chandra, The History of Indian costume from the
first century A.D. to. ‘the beginning of the fourth century
(JISOA. 1940).

Les sculpture (p. 32), and Khabho (p. 272). For loc. cit.
(pp. 3, 6, 14 etc.) read op. cit. The rendering of Siinyavada
{p. 16) as Nihilism should be discarded in favour of the
more accurate term ‘Doctrine of Absolute Truth’. The
reference (p. 272) to Gunadhya’s Brhat-kathd as a poem is
a slip. We do not know on what grounds Kalidasa is assigned
to the Sutga period (p. 55). The want of diacritical marks
throughout the work is much to be regretted. It is difficult to
understand why the author should refer (p. 182 etc.) to late
Burmese Buddhist legends narrated by Spence Hardy as his
authorities for identification of the Amaravati sculptures. It
is also curious to find that for his account (p. 16) of incipient
schisms in Buddha’s life-time and for his interpretations of
sculptures of c. 150 A.D. he can quote no earlier authorities
than the Dhammapada commentary (pp. 187, 193, 195, 198,
199, 200, 202, 214 and 228). The same criticism applies to
his quotation of Dhammapala’s commentray on the Theri-
gatha (p. 192) and of the Avadana-kalpalata (p. 215) for the
interpretation of other sculptures of the same period.

Pailni The Sacred Hill of Muruga: By J. M. Somasun-
daram. Published by the Sri Dandayuthapani Swami Deva-~
sthanam, Palni. Madras, 1941. 48 pp. Price -/12/-.

In this monograph Mr. J. M. Somasundaram, whose
earlier work on The Great Temple of Tanjore was reviewed
by us in a former issue of this Journal, attempts a short
description of the great shrine of Dandayuthapani and
attached temples on and. near the sacred hill of the child-
god Muruga at Palni. The author, who holds the high
post of executive officer of the Sri Dandayuthapani Deva-
sthanam, has succeeded in giving within a short compass
much valuable information about the main shrine and its
adjuncts. We learn from him the topography, history and com-
munication of the sites. the pails history of the main shrine,

the principal festivals, the literary works connected there-
with and so forth. Itis good to learn that under the enlighten-
ed management of the trustees in recent years a Saiva-
Siddhanta Sabha, a Veda-Sivagama Patasala, a library
and a reading-room have been founded on thesite. At
the end of the work the author gives in the form of Appen-
dices a list of twenty-six constituent temples of the Deva-
sthanam and a list of landed properties attached thereto
as well as a chronological list of trustees from 1863 onwards
together with the improvements effected in their time.
Two other Appendices contain a select bibliography (in

‘the original Tamil) of the literature dealing with the shrine

and the English translation of an ancient hymn in honour
of the god Muruga composed according to the orthodox
tradition (which the author accepts unquestioningly) by
Nakkirar, a member of the third Tamil academy who
belonged to about the first century A.D. Nine plates
(including a ground-plan of the main shrine) and twenty-
six illustrations added to the usefulness of this work.

We have noticed a few printing mistakes which may

‘be corrected in a later edition, We may further observe

that the author would have done well in giving his copious
Tamil extracts in an English translation for the benefit of
non-Tamilian readers. For the same purpose it would
have been useful to append a glossary of technical terms.

of the circumstances under which the great Hindu empire
of Vijayanagara came to be established’. For this purpose
he begins with a chapter describing the condition of the
four Hindu kingdoms—those of the Séunas (ordinarily
known as Yadavas), the Kakatiyas, the Hoysalas and the
Pandyas—on the eve of the Muslim invasions. In the four
following chapters he describes the successive waves of
Muslim invasions under the Khaljis and the Tughlaqs, end-
ing in the complete subjugation of the four kingdoms by
the Delhi Sultanate. The sixth chapter briefly sketches
the administration of the new rulers with its characteristic
weaknesses. The dramatic story of the emancipation of the
land from the yoke of Delhi forms the subject-matter of
the seventh chapter. The concluding chapter deals briefly
with the new Hindu kingdoms that arose on the ruins of
of the Muslim empire in the South.

In tracing the eventful history of the country on the
lines sketched above, the author who has already a num-
ber of. important works on South Indian history to his
credit, has. undoubtedly attained great success. His use
of sources is very nearly exhaustive, as he lays
under contribution not only Sanskrit and Tamil literary
works and South Indian inscriptions, but also the important
Persian histories and Portuguese notices. We only wish
he had utilised the evidence of the coins of the Sultans of
Madura. The author shows sound judgment in sifting
the. discrepant and often contradictory evidence of his
authorities on various matters of detail. His style is clear
and forceful. His explanation of historical movements
‘is suggestive and thoughtful, if not always convincing.

We shall make a few remarks. Speaking of the
Hindu re-action following” the successive inroads of Islam,
the author says (p. 146):— -‘The Hindus of the North, though
they clung to. their ancient ‘faith | ever so tenaciously, offered
little or no resistance to their oppressors. They meekly
submitted to all this ‘ill-treatment and betrayed a strange
incapacity to organise themselves to defend their spiritual
NOTICES OF BOOKS . 101

freedom (sic). When, however, the Muhammadans ex-
tended their field of activities and attempted to impose
their yoke upon the Hindus of the Deccan, they found

that the task was not easy of accomplishment....Their

success was evanescent and their authority was overthrown
as quickly as it was established.’- This strange verdict
which is at variance with the authors’ ‘usual sense of fair-
ness, ignores the prolonged. and successful stand made by
the Guhilas and other dynasties of Rajputana, the Ahom
kings of Assam and the Eastern Gangas of Kalinga, for
their independence. Inthe same context (pp. 165-66) the
author accounts for the impermanent character of Muslim
rule in South India by referring to certain characteristics
of the Saivas of that region, ‘which, while distinguishing
them from the other Hindus, reveal a strange affinity to the
followers of Islam.” These features, according to the author,
consisted in their strict monotheism, their faith in themselves
being the chosen of god, their indifference to distinctions of
birth and wealth within their own ranks and their intoler-
ance towards their rival creeds. Elsewhere (pp. 11-12).
however, the author mentions amongst the causes of the
political and social degradation of the Hindus on the eve
of the Muslim invasion, the bitter struggle for supremacy
between Saivaism (specially Vira-Saivaism) and Vaisnav-
ism. We are nowhere told whether and if so how, ‘the
two dominant creeds of Hinduism’ were reconciled to
each other during the interval, so as to ensure the common
solidarity of the people. Nor again does it appear why
the strong points of South‘Indian Saivaism failed to ensure
the immunity of the Hindu Kingdoms in the earlier period.
We cannot conclude without stating that the present
work makes a very important and useful contribution to
the history of the period with which it deals. Its value
would have been enhanced by the addition of maps, genea-
logical tables and a classified bibliography of sources to~
gether wee their. critical notices. i

On the Role of the Central Asian Nomads
In the History of India*

By Dr. P. C. BaccHi

l am grateful to you for the honour you have done me
by asking me to preside over this august assembly. The
responsibility that you have assigned to me is indeed very
great and | am afraid I am not the person who can discharge
it to your satisfaction. It seems that the most difficult task
of a President is to choose the subject of his address.
I have failed to discover a strict principle that might guide
us in this matter and make our task easier. The two alter-
natives before us, | believe, are either to give a survey of
the work done in our field of study since we last met or to
deal with a particular problem that would interest every
one of us. A survey without a proper consideration of the
values will be a simple catalogue of works that are more
or less known to us. An evaluation of the merits and
demerits of such works, again, is beset with difficulties of
which we are all aware. I shall therefore choose the other

alternative and discuss, some problems of the ancient history

of India which, although studied on numerous occasions for
more than half a century, have not yet lost their interest
tous. [am however fully conscious of my short-comings
and | hope you will be indulgent towards me if | ill fulfil
my task.

The problems to which I should like to draw your atten-
tion are connected with the réle of the Central Asian nomads
in the history of India. While dealing with these invaders,
we have been in the habit of attaching greater importance
to the foreign sources of information than to our own
literature. I do not however deny that for nearly one
thousand years, from the end of the second century before
Christ up to the eighth, the Chinese sources supply us with
more definite information on the movements of the Central
Asian nomads than any other source, but there is no
reason for attaching greater importance to the Greek and
Latin texts than to our own for their early history. In fact
the classical writers derived their knowledge of these people
either from the Persians or from the Indians. The recent
researches into the Central Asian antiquities have shown
that the ancient Indians possessed a fairly precise know-
ledge of these people.

The region beyond the Himalays was never so isolated
from India as we often think. The people of Northern
India and specially the people of the Punjab possessed
some knowledge of this region and were in contact with the
nomads almost in every age. They did not consider them
foreigners as we do now, simply because the distinction
between them, both physical and cultural, was not so great
as to create a sharp difference between them. Conflict
arose only in cases when the newcomers tried to unsettle
the established political conditions, but peaceful infiltration
was generally a welcome feature as it contributed to the
prosperity of the country and proved an added military

strength to-the local ruler. The Brahmanical social code

always ‘provided them. with an independent place in the
society. Although it meant the formation of new. castes, it
THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS _ tog

did not hurt their amour-propre, but made them willing
partners of an ever-growing civilisation.

As early as the later Vedic period the Indian writers
show an acquaintance with the people beyond the northern
and north-western frontiers. In the Atharvaveda ( V. 22,
5.9) the fever takman is wished away not only to the
country of the Gandh§ris but also further beyond, to that of
the Bablikas, In the Brahmana literature we again come
across these people (Sat. Br. 1,7,3-5). Two new people
are also spoken of -the Uttarakurus and the Uttaramadras
as distinguished from the Kurus and the Madras settled in
the Punjab (Ait. Br. VIII, 14, 23). The next writer Yaska
who comes immediately after, speaks of another new people
—the Kambojas probably for the first time (Nirukta, II, 2).

The Bahlikas are well known. It appears that the Uttara-
kurus, Uttaramadras as well as the Kambojas too belonged
to the still undefined region of Central Asia beyond the

Himalayas. | The existence of an Uttarakuru ‘in this region
is noted by the Greek writers till the fifth century A. D.
Ptolemy is the first to speak of a town named Ottorokorrha
and of a river and a mountain bearing the same name in the
Serique (Chinese Turkestan) near the mountain Emodos
(Himalaya). Later writers speak of the same place under
the name Oporrocorra (apara and uttara here having the
same meaning). The tradition survived till the 5th century
as Orosius still speaks of the Ottorogorras. The name
Uttaramadra might suggest a connection with the Median
tribes (the Mada) and an. attempt was made a few years
ago to prove that the Maddas.or the Madras of the Punjab
were Median immigrants to India. Amongst the reasons
adduced in favour of this hypothesis stress has been laid on
the unorthodox customs prevalent amongst them and men-
tioned by the Mahabharata. The-epic distinctly speaks of

the king of the Madras as Bahlika-pungava and thus suggests
his connection with the Iranian world... _

The Kambojas also point to the same direction.

Although they are constantly associated. with Gandhara,

Ba

110. P. C. BAGCHI .

still it is impossible to find out their trace on the frontiers
of India. The name of Gandhadra survived for long cen-
turies, but that of the Kambojas was soon forgotten. This
makes. it probable that they belonged to the nomad hordes
of Central Asia which were moving from place to place.
One of their branches seem to have entered India in very
early times, but they must have soon lost their identity as a
distinct people. Other branches of the same people seem
to have entered Eastern Tibet and the valley of the Mekong
from another direction. By this assumption only we can ex-
plain why the name Kambuja was given to the kingdom foun-
ded in the middle velley of the Mekong. In Eastern Tibet
also their name can be traced in the name of the province of
Khams and it is probably from this region that the Kamboja
invasion of Assam and Bengal took place in later times.

In the early Buddhist texts, the Epics as well as the
Puranas, we get a more elaborate scherne to systematise
the geographical knowledge’ possessed by the Indians not
only of India but also of other Asiatic regions. The
principles which guided the compilers of these texts, are
not always evident, but as some of their notions correspond
to actuality, it is not fair to reject the cosmology presented
by them as fanciful. -

The Buddhist texts mention four continents spread
around the central. mount Meru in the following order: in
the south Jambudvipa, in the North Uttarakuru, in the West
Aparagodana and in the East Pirvavideha. Jambudvipa
was generally speaking India, according to the Buddhists.
Uttarakuru,. as we have seen, was the name given to
Chinese Turkestan.. Godana was the name by which
“Khotan was known in ancient times. The oldest form of
the name of Khotan is preserved in the Chinese transcrip-
tion of the Han period as. Yu-t‘ien. The Chinese words
were pronounced in the Han period as *(g)iu-den i.e.
Godana. The. name . Apara-godana thus seems to have
been. used. with | refernce to the region of Khotan. Piirva-
videha must have n meant the eastern zone to the east of

THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS ou

Videha—Videha being the eastern limit of the North Indian
world at the time when this geographical notion was first

formed. ,

The Brahmanical cosmology which is sensibly of a later
period gives us a more elaborate scheme. Jambudvipa
according to it is no longer India alone, but the entire
central belt of the continent as known to the compilers of that
age. It is divided into seven varsas.or regions of which
the first is the Bharatavarsa or India. Another known varsa
is Uttarakuru. The five other varsas are the Kimpurusa,
Hari, Bhadraéva, Ketumala, Ilavrta and Ramayaka. As
the central mountain of the Kimpurusavarsa is mentioned
as Hemakiita, it is possible that this was the name given
to the Himalayan zone. [lavrta might suggest a connec-
tion with the region watered by the Ili river further to the
north. Jambudvipa is again only one of the seven continents.
Amongst the other continents two, the Sakadvipa and the
5 Krauficadvipa, have been described in detail in the Mahéa-
x bharata. As we shall see later on, at least the former

corresponded to reality. .

But although we cannot do full justice to the cosmo-
logical notions contained in the Buddhist and Brahmanical
texts, there is ample evidence to show that the Indian com-
pilers were acquainted with most of the people of the
Central Asiatic regions in the age when these cosmological
notions were systematised. For example one of the early
Sanskrit Buddhist texts, mentions—Cina, Kauéika, Khaéa,
Bahli, Tukhara, Pahlava, Parata, Saka, Vokkana, Ramatha.
The Ramayana locates to the North of | Gandhara and
Madraka—the Yavana, Saka, Parada, Bahlika, Resika,
Paurava, Kimkara, Cina, Aparacina, Tukhara, Barbara,
Kamboja, Darada, Kirata, Tatkana, Pagupala. The Mahé-
bha@rata speaks of the Yavana, Cina, Kamboja, Sakrd-

graha, Kulattha, Hina, Paragika, Ramana (sic. Ramatha),
Abhira, Darada, Kaémira, Paéu(pala), Khasira (? Khasa),
Pafihava {Pahlava), Girigahvara ‘ete. amongst’ the people
living in:the North. The Puranas locate in the same region:

1 P. C. BAGCHI

Bahlika, Vatadhana, Abhira, Kalatoyaka, Pallava, Carma-
khandika, Parada, Harabhusika, Dagamalika, Kamboja,
Darada, Barbara, Hargavardhana, Cina, Tukhara, Culika,
Silika etc. The Brhatsamhita attempts at a more precise
classification: in the West—Haihaya, Vokkana, Ramatha,
Parata Saka; in the NW—Tusara, Madra, Kuliita, Carma-
ranga, Ekavilocana (Ekanetra), Siilika; in the N—Kuru,
Uttarakuru, Vatadhana, Hiina and in the NE Sadupsle
Cina, Khaéga, Ghosa, Kucika.

I will not waste your valuable time on the  identi-
fication of these tribes, many of which are known
to us from previous researches. Yavana, Saka, Parada,
Kamboja, Hiina, Parasgika, Cina are well-known. The
Tusaras or Tukhadras were the people of Tokharestan.
The Carmakhandikas are supposed to have been the peo-
ple of Samarcand. The Silikas, also known as Cilikas
were the Sogdians. The Kucikas or Kugikas may be identi-
fied with the ancient people of Kuci or Kuchar. Vokkana
is identified with Wakhan. The Ekavilocanas remind us
of the one-eyed people whom Herodotus locates in the
extreme north of Central Asia above the Issedones. The
Tafganas or Tankanas may have been connected
with the Donki or the Tunguse. Although we cannot
identify other tribes in the lists referred to above the iden-
tities already noted. are quite sufficient to prove that from
about the second century B.C. to about 500 A.D. the Indian
writers possessed a fairly accurate knowledge of the no-
madic hordes that were moving about in Central Asia.
The cosmological notions recorded by these writers reveal
that they possessed also a fairly precise knowledge of the
lands beyond the Himalayas. ‘Compared with this, the
Greek sources, although indispensable for our modern
studies, do not appear to be of any greater value.

Under these circumstances, 1 should like to attach a
greater importance than hitherto done to the Puranic
accounts of the foreign dynasties that ruled in India after
the fall of the _tnbseriel Andhras.. * ‘The accounts say :

THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS 113
“When the kingdom of the Andhras has come

to an end there will be kings belonging to the lineage
of their servants: 7 Andhras, and 10 Abhira kings,
also 7 Gardabhins, 18 Sakas. There will be 8 Yava-
nas, 14 Tusaras, 13 Murundas and 1] ‘Ha
Maunas).”"

“The Sriparvatiya Andhras will endure 52 years,
the Abhira kings 67 years, the Gardabhins 72 years,
the 18 Sakas 183 years, the 8 Yavanas 87 years. The
earth is remembered as belonging to the Tusaras 7000
years, according to some accounts 500 (but apparent-
ly either 107 or 105 is meant). The 13 future Mu-
rundas along with low caste men, all of mleccha origin
will enjoy it half 400 years (i.e. 200 years). The II
Maunas will enjoy it 103 years. When they are over-
thrown by time there will be Kailakila kings. Then
after the Kilakilas, Vindhyagakti will reign. He
will enter eS the earth after it has known those
kings 96 years.’ ‘

~The Abhiras and Gardabhins mentioned in athe list are re-
een as kings of foreign origin but we know almost nothing
about them. The Yavanas or the Bactrian Greeks have
been recently treated by M. Tarn, a recognised authority
in classical studies. I propose to discuss here the problems
concerning the Saka, the Tusara, the Murunda and the Hina.

The Saka. Problem

If we. take the Puranic: accounts . literally, we re to
admit that the Saka conquerors preceded the Yavanas or the
Greeks in India. At least they were elder contemporaries
in their Indian adventures. The Puranic evidence has, how-
ever, not been given any credence for want of corroborative
facts. The Chinese evidence has been relied upon to
prove that the Sakas could not have entered India before the
commencement of the Ist century B. C. The Greek rule had
been established in the Punjab and i in the Kabul valley about
a century earlier. In fact this is. : regarded as the reason for

/

114 P, C. BAGCHI

which the Sakas came to India not directly by the Kabul
route, but from Drangiana which they had conquered in the
middle of second century. Let us now examine the eviden-
ces again and see how far they are precise enough to admit
of such interpretation.

The Greek writers from the time of Herodotus speak of
the Sakas as a branch of the Scythic people which occupied
Central Asia in early times. Herodotus says that the Persi-
ans used the designation Saka in a loose way. Strabo
(58 B. C.-21 A. D. ) tells us that the Caucasus separated the
Sakai, the Scythes and the Seresin the North from the
Indians in the South. Ptolemy in the second century B.C.
says that the eastern frontier of the Sakai was Scythia.

The Old Persian Inscriptions speak more clearly of the
Sakas than the Greek texts. Thus in the Behistun Inscrip-
tion there is mention of Bactria, Sogdiana, Gandhara, Saka,
Tathagush, Arachosia.and Maka, and again after Parthia
of Margiana, Tathagush and Saka provinces which revolted
against Darius? In the Persepolis inscription we are told
that the eastern provinces of the empire were Arachosia,
India, Gandhara, Saka and Maka. In the Nakshi Rustum
Inscription there is mentionof Zranka (Drangiana), Aracho-
sia, Tathagush, Gandh@ra, India, Saka Haumavarka, Saka
Tigrakhauda, and in the Gold Tablet Inscription of Darius
we are told that his empire extended from Saka beyond
Sogdiana. ( para-sugdam ) to Ethiopia and from India to
Sardis. The Saka Tigrakhauda or the “Sakas who wore
pointed helmets’’ were according to Herodotus the neigh~
bours of the Bactrians and most probably occupied the
Jaxartes region. The Saka Haumavarka who were the same
as the -Amyrgian. Scythians of Herodotus were. those who
had settled in the Persian Province of Drangiana. The
Behistun and the. Persepolis ‘inscriptions really locate
them near Gandhara. The old Persian Inscriptions there-
fore make it clear that the Sakas were living near the
frontiers of India long before the Greeks had come to that
THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS 9115

‘The Indian literature speaks of them, but only at a time
when the Greeks had settled in Bactria: This is the reason
for which the Sakas are closely associated with the Yavanas
in these texts, specially in the Ramdyana, the Manusamhitd
and the Mahdbhdérata. But a particular chapter of the Maha-
bhdrata inserted in the Bhismaparva which gives the des-
cription of the Sakadvipa or “‘the land of the Sakas’”’ seems
to bear an earlier stamp. It is said that there are seven
mountains in Sdkadvipa, named Meru, Malaya, Jaladhara,
Raivata, Syama, Durgagaila and Keéara. The land is divided
into seven varsas: Mahdkdsa near Meru, Kumudottara near
Malaya, Sukumdra near Jaladhara, Kauméra near Raivata,
Manikdficana near Syama, Maudaki near KeSara and Maha-
purusa near DurgaSaila. The text then sayathat there are
four Janapadas or kingdoms in the land of the Sakas, Maga
(or Manga), Magaka, Madnasa and Mandaga. These regions
are watered by different branches of the Ganges viz. Suku-
mari, Kumari, Sitagi, Venika, Manijala, Caksu (i.e. Vaksu),
and Vardhanika’. Regarding the character of the people
the text then says that the Magas are Brahmin by vocation,
Magaks Ksatriya, the Manasas Vaigya and the Mandagas
Sidra.

According to Rapson this‘Sakadvipa would be the name
given to the lower Indus valley after the Sakas had settled
there in the frst-century B. C. This identification has been
suggested by the use of the word dvipa in this connection.
The word dvipa, however, was used in the Puranic and Epic
cosmology ina much broader. sense and not in the narrow
sense of island. Then again there is little ‘doubt about the
identification of the river Vaksu (Oxus) which Howed through
the country of the Sakas. Another river, the Siragi,
may be the same as the Sita which is the name given to
the Yarkand river in some texts. According to an old
notion all the four rivers, Ganga, Sindhu, » Vaksu and
Sita, issued from the same source, the Anavatapta lakes

and hence they could be. known under the same name
Ganga. Of the four people mentioned above the

116 P. C. BAGCHI

Maga reminds us of the Magians, the Maka of the old
Persian inscriptions who according to Herodotus were
a Median tribe. The Maégakas may be very well identified
with the Massagetae another Scythic people mentioned by
Herodotus as a powerful and valiant people dwelling to-
wards the east beyond the river Araxes over against the
Issedonians- It may be noted that the Masakas are also
described in the Mah abhdrata as Ksatriyas. The Mandagas
or Madagas might have been the same as the Mada or the
Medes. The names of two of the varsas seem to corres-
pond to things known from other sources. Kumudottara
may be connected’with the Komedoi of the Greek writers
which extended from the Oxus to the river of Karategin.
Mahakaéa remistds us of Akhasa which the classical authors
place in Scythia. The difficulty in identifying the names of
mountains and rivers is due to, the fact that the old names
have often been replaced by new ones in this region.

That the Sakas were known in India before the establish-
ment of the Greek rule is also indirectly suggested by the
Jaina account as preserved in the Kalaka@cdryakathanaka. In
order to punish the autocratic Gardabhillas of Ujjayini Kalaka
sought for outside help. He could have gone to the Yavanas
as well had they been settled"in the upper Indus valley.
But instead of doing that he went to the Sagakula i. e. the
Saka race beyond the Indus. He induced some of the Saka
chiefs to accompany him. They crossed the Indus in ships
and went to Kathiawar. These chiefs first occupied the
kingdom of Surdstra and divided the country amongst them-
selves. Next they went up to Ujjayini, imprisoned the
Gardabhilla king and set up one of their chiefs as ruler
there. In course of time (kalantarena) Vikramaditya the
king of Malava ousted the Saka dynasty and established his
own era (58 B. C.),. This. dynasty also was destroyed by
another Saka ruler after 135 years of the Vikrama era had
elapsed (78 A. D.). Prof. Sten Konow has given full
eredence to this story. The route followed by the Saka
chiefs indicates’ that. they were coming from the other side
THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS 117 a

of the Indus, probably from Seistan where Saka settlements
had been established already in the Achaemenian period.
But how long did they rule in Ujjayini before the rise of this i:
legendary Vikramaditya in 58B.-C. is not known. The
account vaguely says kdldntarena : after the lapse of some- st
time. Prof. Konow has referred to a late Jaina tradition |
which says that the Sakas ruled at Ujjayini only for four
years. Accordingly the Saka occupation of Ujjayini may
be placed in 61-60 B. C. But the same account attributes a
reign of only 13 years to the Gardabhillas. A little examina-
tion shows that it is only a distorted version of the Puranic
accounts which however assign a reign of 183 years to
the Sakas and 72 years to the Gardabhillas.

One of the oldest Saka rulers of India, Maues had
extended his rule up to Taxila and Gandhara, but we do not
know from which direction. Most of the scholars now
agree that it was from the Saka settlements in the lower
Indus valley. But we should not forget that although some

of his coins appear as imitations of the coins of Demetrios
and Appollodotus the great majority of them bear Parthian
| : influence in the regal formula—Basileus basileun Megaloy
Mayoy. Orosius speaks of a Parthian invasion of India up
to the Hydaspes by Mithradates I (171-138 B. C.). But
this account has been given little credence for insufficient
reasons. ‘ _ me
_1£ we attach less importance to the story of the foundation
of a powerful Greek kingdom extending from the Kabul
valley to the Punjab after the invasion of Demetrios, and
Menander—a kingdom which would be a_ sort of impenetra-
ble barrier against a possible Parthian or Saka invasion from
the side of Bactria, then we can explain things more clearly.
The Sakas had undergone a great Parthian influence, the
language they spoke was the Eastern Iranian dialect and
they had rendered a great help in the foundation of the
Arsacidan dynasty. So a possible Parthian invasion of the
Punjab by Mithradates I, as Orosius tells us, might have
brought the Sakas to the Punjab: along the Kabul valley.

118 P. C. BAGCHI

The Greek opposition would be futile in that case. The
Sakas of Kathiawar and Ujjayini represented an altogether
different branch of the same people that had penetrated
through the lower Indus valley at a much earlier period
possibly with local help as the Kalakdcaryakathanaka would
have us believe,

What is then the iwinoriaice of the Chinese account
regarding the movement of the Sake people from the region
of Ta-hia>? The annals of the former Han dynasty Ts’ien
Han shu contain the following account which is now well
known: | :
“Formerly when the Hiung-nu subjugated the

Ta Yue-che, the latter migrated to the West and
gained the dominion over Ta-hia whereupon the
king of Sai moved south and ruled over Ki-pin.
The Sai were scattered and at times formed several
kingdoms. North-west of Shu-lei, the Heu-suen,
Suen-tu and consanguinous nations are all descen-
dants of the ancient Sai."’

- The Chinese word Sai was. pronounced in Han times |
Sek and hence it is certain that the word was used to render
the name of the Sakas (Greek Saces). The Ta Yue-ches
were defeated by the Hiung-nus in. 176.B.C. They ousted
the Sakas from the Jaxartes region in about 160 B.C. The
Sakas then migrated to Ta-hia (later Tokharestan). Pressed
by the Wu-suns the Yue-ches moved to the south and
occupied Ta-hia. It was then that the King of the Sakas
was obliged to move further south and to go to Ki-pin This
must have taken place before 128 B.C.

The route to Ki-pin which the Saka king followed is
_ clearly stated. He passed the Hien-tu or the hanging passage
while moving towards Ki-pin from his original seat in Ta-
hia. This route was recognised by Chavannes and Sir’
Aurel Stein as. the -Bolor. route through the Yasin valley.
This. was the’ route which was usually followed by the
ancient travellers from: ‘the region of Wakhan to the Indus
valley. and to Soma and ‘Udyane. 3

THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS | 119

If we follow this Chinese account literally, we are driven
to two conclusions; the first, that the Sakas who were turned
out of Ta-hia by the Yue-ches entered India by the Bolor
route and the second, that Ki-pin which they conquered was
Kashmir. The first conclusion has been discarded on the
ground that the Bolor route“was impracticable and the
second has been rejected on the ground that Ki-pin could
not be Kashmir but must be identified with Kabul-Kapisa
It has therefore been supposed that the Sakas went south
from Ta-hia and as it was impossible for them to enter
the Kabul valley owing to the presence of the Greeks in
that region they went westwards.to the direction of Herat
and thence southwards to Seistan. From Seistan they
entered India by th lower valley of the Indus in the first
century B.C. and thence extended their influence north-
wards to the Kabul valley.

1 think that this assumption is not necessary at all. The
Sakas of Ta-hia seem to have represented an entirely different
group and had no relation with the Sakas of Seistan The
Bolor route again was not probably so impraticable as has
been supposed. At least it does not appear to have been
impracticable in the end of the 4th century A. D. when
the first Chinese traveller, Fa-hien and his associates
came to India. Ste . :

Then again the identification of Ki-pin with Kabul-
Kapiéa is an impossibility. Lévi and Chavannes were the
first to propose the identification of Ki-pin of the Chinese
annals with Kashmir. They pointed out that in a number of
Chinese translations: of Buddhist texts the translators use Ki-
pin for translating the name Kashmir up to 581 A.D. Since
581 A.D. the Buddhist translations as well as other Chinese
documents use the name Ki-pin to denote Kapié and not
Kashmir. In recent years there has been a tendency to take
these conclusions too lightly. For example Tarn in his
book ‘The Greeks in Bactria and India,’’ while. identifying
Ki-pin with Kophene (Kabul), ‘refers to Lévi only to point out
that ete Chinese rammed up Kapiga and Bnsnaee? in their

120, ; P, C. BAGCHI

Ki-pin."” The Chinese writers made this confusion only
after 581 A.D. as Ki-pin had by then become too old a
name to convey a precise geographical import. But there is
no ground to believe that the same confusion existed prior to
581 A.D. In the oldest Chinese translation of the Milinda-
pafiha which belong to thé 4th eentury A.D. Kaémira of
the original text is twice rendered in Chinese as Ki-pin.
The Chinese biography of Kumirajiva contains another
corroborative evidence. Kumarajiva was taken from
Kucha to Kashmir by his mother for proper education in
the third quarter of the 4th century A.D. Kashmir was
then a reputed centre of Sanskrit learning. ‘While coming
from the west they crossed the river Sin-t’eou (Sindhu) in
order to go to Kashmir which is called Ki-pin. Of the
description of Ki-pin which we get in the Chinese annals
of the Han and Wei periods, the following points may be
noted: (i) Ki-pin was to the south-east of Ta Yue-che i.e.
Ta-hia. The kingdom of Nan-tu was at 9 days journey to
its north-east and Wur-yi-shan-li to the south-west. Nan-tu
seems to be *Dar-du i.e Darada. Wu-yi-shan-li which is
a transcription of the name Alexandria has been identified
with Kandahar. (ii) The valley of Ki-pin was surrounded by
hill ranges on four sides. It was a flat country having a
length of 800 li from east to west and a breadth of 300 li from
the north to the south. These accounts seem to refer clearly
to Kashmir and not to Kabul-Kapiga. The name Ki-pin
‘itself seems to suggest the same. In Han pronounciation
the first word Ki was definitely a *Ka probably followed
by some consonant which might have beenas. Pin was
pronounced almost certainly in early time pir or wir, Hence
Ki-pin clearly stood for *Ka(s)-pir or *Ka(s)-wir. This form
of the name is also found in the early Greek records in which
Kashmir is either Caspiri or Kaspeira. Ki-pin was thus a
) correct phonetic transcription of the old name of Kashmir.
‘The Sakas of Ta-hia could not have come to Kashmir via
Seistan and the lower Indus valley—they must have come
there by the shorter route—i-e. the Bolor route from Ta-hia.

The Tukhdra Problem

The next problem is what I should like to call the
Tukhara or Tokharian problem. In the dynastic lists of the
Puranas it is said that the Tusara kings succeed the Yavanas
in India. Their number is given as 14. According to the
Matsya the world belonged to them for seven thousand years
(sapta-varsa-sahasrani) whereas according to the Vayu and
Brahmanda they ruled for pafica-varsa-Satani which may be
interpreted either as five hundred years or as 105 years.
Five hundred years would be too long a period for 14 kings
and so it is just probable that they ruled only for 105 years.
The Matsya account may be accordingly corrected as sapta-
varsa-Satan-iha and interpreted as 107 years. Some of the
early Puranas give Tukhara as a variant of Tusara. It is
certain that the cerebral was pronounced as kha when the
name was adopted by the Puranic chroniclers. The
Ramdyana gives the name as Tukhara. The name is given
in the same form by the Mahabharata as well as by two
old Buddhist texts, the Saddharma-smrtyupasthana and the
Mahamdyiiri. The Chinese pilgrims tell us that the Tukhara
Buddhists like the Ceylonese had a special monastery built
for them at the Mahabodhi in the 7th century. In the same
century Bana writes in his Harsacarita that Harsa used to
get taxes from the mountainous and inaccessible region of
the Tusaras (atra paramegvarena tusdragailabhuvo durgadyah
grhitah karah). This only shows that Tukhara as a distinct
people and the land of the Tukharas (Tokharestan) asa
distinct country in the mountainous regions beyond the
frontiers of India were known t to the Indians as late as the

middle of the 7th century A, D._

The classical authors mention aul people eas the same
name. Thus Pliny says——‘‘After the Attacores (the same as
Ottorokorras) come the Phuni (Phruni), Thocari and Casiri
(which seems to be a mistake for Caspiri), the last belonging
to India.’" Ptolemy speaks of them as. Thagouroi, Periegetes
(2nd century) and all later writers up to. the. 4th century as

122 P. C. BAGCHI

Tochari.- The Tokharians therefore according to these
sources were a central Asian people living to the north of
the Caspiri or Kashmir.

The Chinese sources of the Han period speak of a
people named Ta-hia. They were living as early as the 2nd
century B.C. in th Oxus region. The two Chinese words Ta
and hia were pronounced in early times as D’a-g’a and it
stood in all probability for the name Dogar or Tukhar. From
the 5th century the name appears in the Chinese annals
as T'u-ho-lo *T’u-zuo-la ie. Tukhara. The king of that
country sent ambassadors to China in 453, 457 and 465 A.D.
At the time when Hiuan-tsang visited the country it had
passed into the hands of the Western Turks. The pilgrim
tells us that Tokharestan in that period was a very exten-
sive kingdom. It reached the Tsong-ling (the Pamirs) on
the east, Persia on the west, the Hindukush on the south
and the Iron Pass or Derbend in the north. The Oxus flowed
through this country. Henceforth contact with China
remained almost uninterrupted for about two centuries. It
is in this period that the Tibetan texts speak of the country
of Tho-gar or Tho-dgar and of the Buddhist monks of that
country who had gone to Tibet to participate in the work
of translation of Buddhist texts. The Uigurs also speak
of them as Tori and of their country as Twarstn i. e.
Tokharestan. |

We therefore see that from about the second century
B.C. to about the middle of the 7th century A. D. all sources
of information, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Chinese concur in
recognising a people called Tukhara living in the country
which came to be known in later times as Tokharestan. The
original seat of the people was the Upper valley of the Oxus
in the region of Badakshan. The Puranic sources would
have us believe that kings of this Tukhara origin conquered
India from the Greeks and set up their own rule. Fourteen
of their rulers reigned. in India for a little over hundred
years. Kis vines 4
THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS © 123

These are precisely the rulers who are designated Kushan
by the modern historians of India. The Greek legends on
the coins of these rulers give them the name Korsano Kosano
etc. and the Kharosthi Inscriptions Kusana, Khusana and
Kusana. The name of a king of this group of rulers called
Maharaja Gusana may be connected with the same name.
The occurrence of the initial letter as g, k, kh, and Greek k
and x shows that it was probably a guttural fricative which
could not be exactly rendered into an Indian form. Prof.
Konow probably rightly considers that the word is an
lranian form with the genitive plural suffix of Gna which is
used as a rule with the Iranian ethnic names. In that case
the base would be Gusa or Kusa. In fact one of the Kushan
rulers, Kanishka is described as a member of the Kuga race
in a Buddhist text ascribed to Aévaghosa who according
to the Buddhist tradition was contemporaneous with that
great ruler. .

In order to explain the origin of this family name an
evidence contained in the old Han annals has been referred
to. According.to it the Kusanas would be a branch of the
Ta Yue-che nomads of whom a branch was called Kuei-
shuang- The passage which contains this evidence occurs
in the annals of the later Han dynasty Heou Han shu. Let
us consider this passage again : =

‘Previously the Yue-ches were conquered by the Hiung-
nus. They then went away to Ta-hia and divided this
kingdom into five hi-heous namely Hieu-mi, Shuang-mi.
Kuei-shuang, Hi-tuen and Tu-mi. More than hundred years
after this the hi-heou of Kuei-shuang named K’ieu-tsieu-k’io
attacked and vanquished the four other he-heou, called him-
self king and the name of his kingdom become Kuei-shuang.
He invaded Ngan-si, conquered Kao-fu, became victorious
over P’u-ta and Ki-pin and possessed these kingdoms entire-
ly. Kieu-tsieu-k’io died at- the age of more than 80
years. His son Yen-kao-chen became king in his place,
in his turn he conquered T’ien-chu (India) and established
there a chief to administer it. From. this time the Yue-ches

3

124 P. C. BAGCHI

became extremely powerful. All the different countries
call their king, the king of Kuei-shuang, but the Han call
them Ta Yue-che retaining their ancient title.”’

The names of the two kings K’ieu-tsieu-k’io and Yen-
kao-chen have been corrected as K’ieu-tsio-kie and Yen-
‘kao-mi by no less a Chinese authority than Prof. Pelliot.
When these corrections are admitted, the names appear in
their archaic pronunciation as K’i?u-dz’i®u-kiap and. lam-
kau-mijie. These may be restored accurately as Kuju Kapa
and Vema Kafi which are exactly the names of Kujula Kada-
phises and Wema Kadphises. According to the latest in-
terpretation of the passage it would appear that the five
hi-heous belonged to the old kingdom of Ta-hia or the
Tukharas. They temporarily became vassals of the Ta
Yue-che, but later on the hi-heou of Kuei-shuang supplanted
the Yue-che rule and established his own. He was there-
fore a Tukhara, but the Chinese writers followed the old
custom and continued to call them Ta Yue-che. Thus Kujulo
Kadphises who supplanted ‘the Yue-che rule was primari-
_ ly a Tukhara and secondarily .a Kuei-shuang. So far as the
first appellation is concerned the Indian sources amply’
confirm it. It was the Tukharas who followed the Greeks
in India and they were not known by any other name. As
Chinese evidence shows, Kuei-shuang was the name of the
principality over which Kujula ruled as a hi-heou. This was
the name given to the kingdom founded by him after the
overthrow of the Yue-che rule simply because the nucleus
of that kingdom was his own principality. Kuei-shuang
‘was not an ethnic mame and. hence the Sanskrit. sources
do not mention it but retain the name Tukhara.

The connection between Kuei-shuang and Kusana is not
very clear. Kuei-shuang, in old pronunciation Kjwei-siang,
was something. like Khugana_ or Kusana. Kadphises | uses
both Kogano_ and Xosano on his coins.. In the Panjtar ins-
cription of the year. 122 there is mention of a, Maharaja.

Khusana. The titles show that they were two different
rulers but who they were, we do not know. There is again
reference to the Gusanavaméa and its scion General Lala
in the year 18 of Kaniska in the Manikiala Stone Inscription. -

This uncertainty in the use of the name Kusana is more
the reason why we should attach greater importance to the
ethnic name Tukhara given not only in the Puranas but also
in all other sources.

We have said that the Tukharas were not the Ta Yue-
ches.. They continued to be so called by the Chinese his-
torians by mistake. The Ta Yue-ches had probably merged
into the Tukhara people and adopted the local culture. This
is the reason why they are only vaguely remembered by the
Chinese historians. They are last mentioned only in con-
nection with the Kidarites. A Chinese annal (Pei-she) tell us
that king Ki-to-lo (Kidara) of Ta Yue-che, driven by the
Juan-juan shifted to the town of Po-lo (B’ak-la: Balkh) and
then conquered Northern India and the 4 kingdoms to the
north of Gandhara. The annal then says that Kidara had.
asked his son to occupy the city of Fu-leu-sha (Purusapura)
and that this is the reason why the kingdom of his son was
called Siao Yue-che or Little Yue-che.

This brings us to another question, that of the Little Yue-
ches. Some scholars are still inclined to hold that Kaniska
belonged to the Little Yue-che and that he entered India
from Chinese Turkestan by a different route. The late
Baron de Staél Holstein was the first to put forward this
theory. He was of opinion that the Kidarites were called
Little Yue-che because the tradition of the Little Yue-che
was being perpetuated at Peshawar: by the successors of
Kaniska. But we have seen that the Chinese text is quite
clear on this point. The text. first speaks ‘of the Great
Yue-che kingdom of Kidara then of the ‘kingdom founded at
_ Peshawar by his son. The latter was called Little Yue-che

so that it could be distinguished from the kingdom of the
father, The annalist had no knowledge of the fact that
there was a king called Kaniska and that his Reon was at

126 P. C. BAGCHI

Peshawar. And he was writing in the middle of the 5th
century A.D. .

There is a slightly earlier evidence on the Little Yue-ches, °
In a Buddhist-text translated in 413 Kumarajiva translates
the name Tukhdra as Siao-Yue-che or Little Yue-che.
Kumiarajiva was a native of Central Asia and therefore the
information supplied by him on this point should be seri-
ously considered. Prof. Pelliot would like to explain it
thus: “‘After the rupture of relation between China and the
West in the last quarter of the 3rd century the Great Yue-
ches had been forgotten in China; Only the Little Yue-ches
were spoken of. As Kuméarajiva was writing for the Chinese
he used the terminology known to them in his times and
rendered the namé Tukhara as Little Yue-che because they
were the only Yue-ches whose name was sti!l understood.
Otherwise it is inconceivable that a native of Central Asia
would explain the name Tukhara as Little Yue-che who had
never come to Ta-hia and had been driven by the Hiung-
nus to the South-East to Kan-su”.

There is therefore no reason to think that Kaniska was
a Little Yue-che. The Little Yue-ches had lost their identity
amongst the barbarians of South-Eastern China just as the
Great Yue-ches had lost theirs amongst the Tukharas. Besides
these Little Yue-ches had no connection either with Ta-hia
(Tukhara) or with Kuel-shuang (Kusana).

- There is another: point to which | should like to draw
your attention in this connection. It is the confusion in late
literature between two different names the Tukhara and the
Turuska. In the Garuda’and Vamana Purdnas we have
Turuska and Turaska in the place where we should have
expected Tukhara or Tusara, Kalhana while speaking of
the Shahi rulers of Afghanistan who claimed descent from
Kaniska calls..them Turuska, Hemacandra in his Abhi-
dhdnacintémani. probably refers to the same Shahi rulers as

the 7th century A.D. which I edited a few years ago, the
Sanskrit name of the Tu-kiues (Turks) is given as Truska-
gana. Tokharestan had passed into the hands of the
Western Turks in the 7th century and since then it was
natural for all late Sanskrit writers to make an easy confu-
sion between Tukhadra and Turuska just as the earlier
Chinese writers had done in calling the Tukharas Yue-che
after the Yue-che conquest of the country.

The Murunda Problem

Although the Murundas are regarded as a separate
dynasty of rulers who succeeded the Tukharas, some scholars
would consider them as identical with the Sakas. Sten
Konow explains the word as a Saka word meaning “Lord”,
‘Master’ and takes it to be identical, with the Chinese ex-
pression Sai-wang “‘the king of the Sakas’’ which the anna-
lists use in connection with the Saka migration from Central
Asia. Konow’s treading and interpretation of the word
muroda in the Zeda inscription is far from certain. Its
connection with Murunda is still more improbable.

On the contrary the Puranas consider the Murundas as
quite distinct from the Sakas. All of them agree in stating
that the Murundas followed the Tukharas in India and that
13 of their kings ruled in India along with low caste men,
all of Mleccha origin. The duration of their rule was accord-
ing to some sources 400 years whereas according to other
sources 200 years. Who were these Murundas?

We know that the Murundas were in India before the
foundation of the Gupta empire. The Allahabad Pillar Ins-
cription of Samudragupta tells us that the Murundas were
amongst those who accepted the vassalage of the Guptas.
The name next occurs in the Khoh copperplate Inscription
of the beginning of the sixth century. We are told there
that the mother of the Maharaja Sarvanatha of Ucchakalpa
was Murundadevi, also called Murundasvamini. She was s0
called probably because she was a princess of the Murunda
dynasty. | ae oui

The mention of the Murundas is found in earlier texts
too. Prof. Lévi was the first to deal with these texts. The
Chinese annals have preserved the record of a political
mission which was sent to India from the Hinduised king-
dom of Fu-nan in Indo-China in the 3rd century A.D. We
are told that in the period 222-277 A.D. the king of Fu-nan
sent one of his relatives to India. The ambassador started
from Fu-nan, went out of the mouth of the river Teu-kiew-li
(Takkola 2) and following the great bend of the littoral right
towards the north-west entered a big gulf which bordered
on different kingdoms. At the end of a little more than a
year he entered the mouth of the river of T’ien-chu (India).
He went up this river, covered a distance of about 7000 li
and arrived at his destination, The king of India was taken
by surprise to learn that there were such men on the distant
shores of the ocean. He sent with him various presents to
the king of Fu-nan and amongst them there were four horses
of the Yue-che country. The Indian ambassadors who went
to Fu-nan along with this mission were met by the Chinese
ambassador at the Funanese court. Being questioned he
told the latter that the title of the king of India was Meu-lun
and that the capital where he resided was guarded by two
consecutive circles of ramparts and that the ditches were
constantly fed by the water carried by canals from the river.
The description of the city and the palace as given by the
Indian ambassadors reminds one of the splendour of
Pataliputra. as :

The Chinese name, as Prof. Lévi has shown, is a faithful
transcription of the name Murunda. Piclemy locates the
Marundai in the same region, in Eastern India, on the right
bank of the Ganges. The Jaina version of the Sirnhasana-
dodtrirnika tells us that a. Marunda-raja was the king of
Kanyakubja. The ' Prabandhacintamani of Merutunga tells
us that the Marundaraja had his capital at Pataliputra. Another
Jaina legend would have us believe that Padaliptasiiri who
was a contemporary of Nagarjuna had cured a Munindaraja
from a serious. disease and. converted him to Jainism.

THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS © 129:

Although these evidences are few and insufficient they
are conclusive enough to prove the existence of Murunda
kings in India from the Kushan period up to the Gupta
period. The geography of Ptolemy and the Chinese evi-
dence discussed above definitely show that the Murundas
were established in Eastern India in the 2nd and 3rd cen-
turies A.D. and that they possessed at least two important.
cities, Kanyakubja and Pataliputra, the latter being probably
their capital till the rise of the Guptas.

It is therefore permissible to suggest that the Murundas
had come to India along with Tukharas and that they had
set up a kingdom in Eastern ‘India first-as vassals of the
Tukharas and then on their downfall as independent rulers.
Their connection with the Yue-ches is suggested by the
present of the four horses of the Yue-che country which
they sent to Funan. Then again when Hemacandra in his
Abhidhanacintamani connects them with Lampaka
(Lamghan) it does not mean that they were known in his

times. He got this information from some’ older sources.

which knew that the Murundas had come by way of
Lamghan. That was not the way followed by the Sakas in
course of their invasion of India. The Sakas again had gone
up to Eastern India and none of the old sources connect
the Sakas with Pataliputra. The Murundas therefore in all
probability were a Tukhara tribe like the Kushans and
partially filled up the gap in the political history of India
from the downfall of the Imperial Kushans to the rise of the
Guptas. This fact was known to the Puranic chroniclers.

It seems we can trace the Murundas in Central Asia

alongside the Tukharas. The classical writers such as Strabo, —

Pliny and Periegetes speak of a people called Phrynoi who
lived near the Tochari. If we are to believe the evidence of
Pliny, the Phrynoi or Phruni lived to the south of the moun-
tain Attacoris, the Tochari lived to the south of the Phrynoi
and the Casiri i.e. Caspiri or Kashmir to the south of the
Tochari. The name of the Phrynoi could be very well ren-
dered in Sanskrit as Mrunda or Murunda. ‘The Puranic chro-

moran arieennenenenraesinn

niclers had probably some hesitation in rendering the name
as such. Thus the Vayu-purdna which is in many respects
one of the most trustworthy texts renders the name not exactly
as Murunda or Muranda, but as Purunda or Purand. The
cerebralisation of the original dental final does not really
make any difficulty as it has other examples too.

The Hana Problem

The Hiina question, I believe, still remains a problem in
Indian history. The reason is this. Kalidasa in his
Raghuvarhga in connection with the digvijaya of Raghu
speaks of the Hiinas as living on the banks of the Vaksu or
the Oxus. Prof. K. C. Chattopadhyaya in a very learned
monograph on Kalidasa has tried to establish the priority
cf Kalidasa over ASvaghcsa in the field of artificial pceiry.
He is of opinion that Kalidasa lived in the first century
B.C. If we accept this theory we have to admit that the
Hiinas were known in India already before the Christian era.
On the contrary we have so long maintained that the Hiinas
were not known in India before the fifth century, They
appeared for the first time on the Indian soil in the time of
Skandagupta (455-467 A.D.) under the distinctive name Hina.
They were at that time driven away. They appeared again
towards the end of the same century and this time succeeded
in establishing an independent Hiina kingdom in the Punjab.
They ruled up to the.second quarter of the sixth century
as: paramount rulers when they received a crushing defeat
at the hands of Yagodharman of Malwa.

These Hinas who appeared in India in the fifth century
A.D. were the Hepthalite Huns or the White Huns, Hepthal,
Chinese Ye-t’a, was the eponymous hero of the race who in
484 A.D. defeated and killed Peroz, the king of Persia. In
lran the principal centres of these Huns were Badakshan
and Bamiyan. It was in this region that Song-yun met them
in the beginning of the sixth century. It was from this region
that they penetrated into India. It has been so long main-
tained that they. were the. only. Huns known i in India.
THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN NOMADS = 131.

But what about the old Hiung-nus of the Chinese annals?
After they had driven the Yue-ches away from the eastern
part of Chinese Turkestan in the second century B.C, they
continued to play an important political réle in the history
of Central Asia for long centuries. Such a powerful people
must have been known to the Greek, Latin and Sanskrit
writers long before the appearance of the Hepthalites. But
under what name were they known?

The Indian literature is not silent on the Hinas. The
Mahabharata speaks of the Hiinas and generally in associa-
tion with the Paragikas (hundh pdragsikah saha). Amongst
the Puranas the Brahmdnda and the Visnu only mention
them. But none of these texts can be definitely placed before
the 5th century A.D. The Ramayana which bears the stamp
of a more definite age does not mention the Himas. The
oldest translation of the Mahdmdayiiri which belongs to the

5th century does not either speak of the Hinas. Both these .

sources however know the Sakas, Yavanas and Palhavas.
The classical writers do not speak of the Hunnus before
the sixth century. The earlier writers mention another people
which may be identified with them. Thus Orosius who wrote
in the beginning of the fifth century or towards the end of
the 4th says: ‘‘Between the sources of the Ganges and
those of the river Ottorogorras, situated to the north in the
region of the Paropanisades. mountains, the Taurus moun-
tain extends. The Caucasus mountain extends between the
sources of the Ottorogorras and the town of Ottorogorras
through the country of the Chuni, Scythes and Gandarides.”’
The variants given in the different. manuscripts for Chuni
are Chunos, Funos, Hunnos, Hunnus,
The Hiung-nu of the Chinese annals looks like the
Hunnus of the Latin writers of the: sixth century and like

the Hiina of the Sanskrit literature and inscriptions men- |

tioned from the end of the fifth century onwards. We
should however bear in mind ‘that ‘Hiung-no i is the Pronun-

ciation of about the same ‘period. © The earlier prorauncia-_

tion of the Chinese name. was ae ong-nuo. iit, ‘commenced

with a guttural fricative which disappeared in later pronun-
ciation. This guttural fricative was transcribed by the earlier
classical writers as Khu. Towards the end of the fifth and
the beginning of the sixth it had already changed into Hu.
It is to this stage that the Latin Hunnus and Sanskrit
Hiina belong.

It is thus clear that although the Hiung-nu hordes might
have been known in India under a different name they
could not be mentioned as Hiina before the fifth and sixth
centuries A.D. In this connection | would propose to make
another correction of a common error. A Roman historian
of the 4th century tells us that in circa 358-360 A.D. the king
of the Chionitae named Grumbates helped king Shapur Il
of Persia against the Romans in the siege of Amida.
Cunningham suggested that the Chionitae were either the
Kushans or the Tokharoi. But we have just seen that they
were probably the same as the Chuni or the Hiung-nus. It
is possible that they were in this period quite mixed up with
the Tokharoi but they cannot be on any account called
Kushan. ,

The Puranic accounts tell us that the Murunda kings were
followed in India by the Hina rulers. Although some texts
give the variant Mauna, Hiina seems ta be the correct read-
ing. They had eleven rulers who reigned for three hundred
years. From the Inscriptions however we know only of two
Hiina rulers namely Toramana and Mihirakula. They reign-
ed from about 490 A.D. to 540 A.D, Yagodharman’s victory
only put an end to the growth of the Hiinas as an imperial
power in India, The Hiina rule must have continued in the
Punjab for ‘several centuries that followed and the Puranic
chroniclers are probably right in attributing to them a reign
of about. 300 years. It was the disintegration of the Hina
kingdom in the Punjab that led to the rise of different ruling
clans in, Northern India. ) |

The. problem of the Hinas | is interconnected with the
problem of the rise of some of the early medieval dynasties

the origin of the Rajput clans who are now regarded by most
of the scholars as of Scythic or Hiina origin. My remarks
will be confined only to the consideration of certain facts

' which have not been so far properly noted, The first of this

concerns the origin of the Gurjaras. They are looked upon
as a Hiina race although their name has not been as yet
traced to any Central Asian source. In order to do this we
have probably to go to the old race movements in that
region. The Han annals speak of three different people the
Hiung-nu, the Wu-sun and the Yue-che. When the Hiung-
nus turned out the Yue-ches from their criginal home, the
latter were compelled to migrate first to the country of the
Wu-sun which was in the region of the [li river. The Wu-sun
subsequently drove the Yue-ches. out of their country with
the help of the Hiung-nus. We are told in this connection
that the minor king of the Wu-sun was brought up amongst.
the Hiung-nus. It is just possible that the Wu-sun had Hun
affinities. The. old pronunciation of the name “Uo-suen in-
all likelihood commenced with a consonant which was later on
dropped and that consonant was most probably a guttural.
In the 4th century the name was something like Gusur which
gave rise to the name Gujar, The Wu-sun or the Gujars
must have moved to India along with the Huns in the fifth
century A.D. and on the downfall of the Hun eae set
up their own rule. ies
The Turks were also of Buti origin. Thess ancestors of
the Turks were a group of Hiung-nu families bearing the clan
name Assena. The word Tiirk in old Turkish meant
“mighty.”’ The Chinese name Tu-kiue was based on a
Mongol plural Tiirk-kiitt. The Sanskrit name Turuska was
established through such intermediate | forms as Turuk,
Turukkhu. The Turkish power rose in the 6th century
and in the 7th century, shortly after 638 A.D., the chief of
the Turks drove back the Persians to the West and con-
guered all the old Hepthalite dominions up to the frontiers

of Kabul. The Turks had taken Balkh and Herat as early
as the year 589 and in 599 we hear that they were assisting
their vassals the Kushans and the Hepthalites against the
Armenians and the Persians.

The Turks had a hierarchical organisation beginning with
the princes of the blood up to the officer of high ranks.
The first was called teghin who were princes of the blood.
- The officers of the highest official rank were called Kulu-
chiir. It was suggested long ago that the Sanskrit word
Thakura was an adaptation of the Turkish word teghin.
It is just possible that the dynastic name Kalachuri is also
of Turkish origin. The founders of the dynasty were at first
the Kuluchiir or the highest Turkish officials. They had
set up an independent kingdom when the central power had
weakened. It is to be noted in this connection that the
Kalachuris claimed descent from Sahasrabahu Arjuna.
Inspite of the fact that the latter is celebrated in Indian
mythology he reminds us of Assena from whom the innumer-
able Turkish hordes claimed their descent. If we thus
assume that the Turks had come to India along with the
Huns or shortly after them, we can explain a significant refer-
ence to them in a Haihaya Inscription. We are told in
this inscription that Kokkalla “‘plundered the treasuries of
Karnata, Vanga, Gurjara, Konkana and Sakambhari kings
and also those born of the Turuska and Raghu families.”’ .
The Gurjara-Pratiharas claimed descent from the Raghu
family. But who were those born of the Turuskas? |
believe that they were the Kalachuris and such other Turkish
iribes that had followed the Huns in India.

not quite solved the?problems, J hope, ILhave succeeded in

the Central Asian nomads to India is an essential corollary

presented other ramifications of the same civilisation that

spread from eastern Iran right up to the frontiers of China
through mountain gorges and desert sands. Hence their
contribution to the development of Indian civilisation in-

creased its complexity by introducing traits that were analo-—

gous but distinct in forms. This phenomenon repeated
itself almost in every age throughout the period with which
we are just now concerned. | therefore believe that not
only the political history but also the history of the art,
society and religion of the entire period has to be studied
against this wider background. Only then we will be ina
position to follow step. by step the evolution of our great
civilisation.

King Suryavarman | of Kambuja

Dr. R. C. Mayumpar

Siryavarman | played a prominent part in the history
of Kambuja at the beginning of the eleventh century A. D.
and we possess quite a large number of inscriptions belong-
ing to hisreign. But there are many obscure points in his
history, on some of which important theories have been
propounded in very recent times. It is necessary to
review them in order to find out to what extent, if any, the
prevailing views about the life and times of Siryavarman |
require revision and modification.

1. The struggle for the throne.

Siiryavarman suddenly appears on the stage of _Kambuja
politics on the death of Jayavarman V, the last ruling
member of the illusttious family founded by Indravarman.
This event took place in 923 5. (=1001 A.D.) and in that
very year Udayadityavarman | as well as Sitryavarman
issued inscriptions as rulers." Two years later another
ruer Jayaviravarman appears on the scene. All these
clearly indicate that the death of Jayavarman V was follow-
ed by a dispute for succession and there were at least three
climants for the throne.

Until recently the view was. iginetally held that Sirya-
varman and Jayaviravarman were identical. It was first
propounded by Aymonier who believed that the new ruler
at first assumed the latter name, and changed it, after a
few years, for the former. M. Finot found a corroboration
of this in the fact that both these rulers are expressly said

article, are arranged Sheonslocically in BEFEO., Vol. XXXIV,

in their records to have ascended the throne in 924 §.
(=1002 A.D.).? M. Coedés has, however, demonstrated®
that this view is untenable. He has referred, in the first
place, to an inscription engraved on a stele found at
Prasat Khna, which incidentally mentions that a family of
chowrie—bearers served thirteen kings from Jayavarman I]
to Stiryavarman I. Now there are only twelve kings during
this period if we regard Jayaviravarman and Sdryavarman
as identical, and we get the requisite number 13 only if we
regard them as separate rulers. This inference is supported
by an analysis of the records bearing the names of these
two rulers. The name of Siryavarman appears in records
bearing dates (in Saka era) 923, 924, 928, 930, 933 and the
following years, while Jayaviravarman issued records dated
925, 927 and 928. Itis thus no longer possible to support
Aymonier’s view that Jayaviravarman was the name
assumed by Siryavarman during the first few years of his
reign. Further, an analysis of the findspots of the inscrip-

tions bearing these two names, and dated between 923 and

929, shows that while those of Jayaviravarman are generally
found in the west, in Angkor region, those of Siryavarman
are confined to the north-eastern part of Kambuja.

We must, therefore, hold that Siryavarman and Jayavira-
varman were different persons and both contested the
throne of Kambuja. As- mentioned above both claim to
have ascended the throne in 9245S. This creates no diffi-
culty so far as Jayaviravarman is concerned, for his earliest
record is dated 925 S., and we may easily presume that he
proclaimed himself king one year earlier.. But as we have
one record dated 923 expressly mentioning Siryavarman
as the ruler it is not easy to understand the statement in the
later records that he ascended the throne in 924 S. |

An explanation is probably to be found in the attitude’

of these rulers to Udayadityavarman 1. Two records of

2 BEFEO,, Vol, XXVIII, p. 73 £0. 3.
3 BEFEO., Vol. XXXIV, pp. 420.

38 R. C. MAJUMDAR
this king, both dated 923, have been found at Koh Ker and

Prasat Khna, in the northern part of Kambuja. No record
of his of any later date has yet been found. According to
the Prasat Khna‘ Inscription Udayadityavarman’s mother
was the elder sister of the queen of Jayavarman V, the
preceding king, and the younger sister of Rajapativarman,
the general of the same king. This relationship is not, of
course, such as would make us believe, without further
evidence, that Udayadityavarman was the legitimate heir
to the throne. But it proves in any case that he was related
to Jayavarman V, and this cannot be said of either Sirya-
yvarman or Jayaviravarman. It is, therefore, a reasonable
assumption that Udayadityavarman succeeded Jayavarman V
immediately after his death in 923S. Siryavarman cer-
tainly, and Jayaviravarman probably, contested this access-
ion, and Udayadityavarman was defeated and pro-
bably killed’ in 9245. When, after his death, the struggle
for the throne. was confined between the two other rivals,
both chose to regard Udayadityavarman as the legitimate
heir and counted their accession to power only from 924 S.
the date of his death. This is the only plausible explana-
tion of the fact that while the record of Siryavarman as king
is actually dated 9235S. the date of his accession to the
throne is given in several records of later years as 924 S.

Whether Siryavarman contested the throne immediately
after the death of Jayavarman V or rebelled against Udaya-
dityavarman | after the latter had ascended the throne
is not definitely known. But the second view seems pro-
bable. Verse 7 of the Prah Khan Inscription might throw
some light on this point, but unfortunately its meaning is not
quite clear. Referring to Siiryavarman it says:—

*‘Ranastho rajasankirnad rajiio rajyam jahara yah I

Finot who originally guid this inscription’ translates
the passages as follows :— :

“He took away: in battle the sovereignty of aking mixed

4 BEFEO., Voi. Xt, p40. 5: BEFEO.; Vol. IV, p. 672.
ees cone

KING SURYAVARMAN I OF KAMBUJA 139

with other kings."” The crucial word in the verse is ‘raja-
sankirndd’ which qualifies ‘rdjfio.’ Finot’s translation
‘mixed with other king’ does not seem to convey much.
According to Sanskrit lexicons the word ‘sankirna’ means
also ‘intoxicated’ and ‘of mixed caste’, while sankirna-
yuddha means a ‘confused fight,” “a melee.’ It is, therefore,
possible to interpret the verse so ‘as to mean that Sirya-
varman seized the kingdom by defeating its ruler who was
either of impure origin or of a haughty character, or because
there was a confused fighting for it among many kings.
In other words, he justified his action on the ground that
the king was an undesirable person or that there were

_ many aspirants to the throne whose mutual quarrels led to

a state of chaos and confusion in the kingdom. But what-
ever interpretation we accept, and irrespective of the
question whether the pleas put forward by Siiryavarman
are true or not, the verse in question seems to indicate that
Siryavarman fought with one who was generally recognised
as king. This king was most probably Udayadityavarman I.
Whether Siryavarman raised a revolt against him because
he was considered undesirable or stood asa claimant to
the throne when the power and authority of Udayaditya-
varman was being challenged by others, it is difficult
to say. But that Udayadityavarman ruled for some time
before Siiryavarman entered the field against him seems
to be the most reasonable view.

The dated records of Siiryavarman and Jayaviravarman,
referred to above, prove beyond doubt that both ruled in
different parts of Kambuja at least up to the year 928.
Subsequently Jayaviravarman was_ defeated | and Sirya-
varman ruled over the whole of Kambuja, as is proved by
his numerous records. Some light is thrown on the struggle
between these two rivals by an inscription discovered at
Tuol Don Srei which states that Siryavarman had to carry
on a struggle for nine years.° Perhaps this refers to his

6 BEFEO., Vol. XXXIV, p. 427.

140 R. C. MAJUMDAR

fight with Jayaviravarman. In that case we may assume
that this contest went on from 924 S. to 932 S. when
Jayaviravarman was finally defeated and Siryavarman
became master of the whole kingdom. This view is suppor-
ted by the ten inscriptions, all dated 933 S., eight of
which are engraved on the pillars. of the Gopuram leading
to the inner court of the royal palace of Angkor Thom,
and two on gateways of a neighbouring building.” They
contain the identical text of an oath, and the names of
district officers numbering more than four thousand, who
took it in the presence of the sacred fire, the dcdryas and
the Brahmanas offering unswerving and life-long homage
and allegiance to king Stiryavarman and dedicating their
lives to his service. These officers swore that they “‘shall
not honour any other king, shall never be hostile (to their
king) and shall not be the accomplices of any enemy.”” This
somewhat extraordinary record may not unreasonably be
assumed to indicate the termination of the civil war and
an attempt on the part of the victorious king to take effective
steps to prevent its recurrence.
2. The origin of Siryavarman

Siryavarman, who thus succeeded in defeating all his
rivals, does not appear to have any legitimate claim to the
throne. Long after he had been firmly seated on the throne
claims were made to connect him, though remotely, with —
the old royal families. The Prasat Kev Inscription’ says
that he was born in the family of Indravarman. The
Phnom Pra Vihar’ Inscription repeats the same thing and
adds that his queen Sri Viralaksmi was born in the royal
line of Sri Harsavarman and Sri lanavarman. This is corro-
borated by Prasat Khna Inscription.” On the other hand

KING SURYAVARMAN I OF KAMBUJA 141

the Vat Thipedi Inscription" connects him with the mater-
nal family of Indravarman. The Lovek Inscription” also
probably refers to Siiryavarman as descended from the
maternal family of Jayavarman V, but as a portion
of the verse is missing, one cannot be sure of the
interpretation. These vague statements seem to indicate
that Siryavarman had no legimate claim to the throne by
his relationship with any of his immediate predecessors,
though he and his queen probably belonged to aristocratic
families which claimed some relationship, however remote,
with the royal family of Indravarman.

It is necessary, in this connection, to discuss the theory
propounded by M. Ccedés,” that Siiryavarman was the son
of a Malyan king. This view is based on a passage in
Camadevivarnsa, a Pali chronicle composed about the
beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. It is recorded in
this chronicle that the king of Kambuja, the son of the king
of Siridhammanagara, attacked Haripufijaya (Lamphun
in N. Siam) about twenty years before its inhabitants emi-
grated to Sudhammapura (Thaton in Burma). This latter
event, which is also referred to in other chronicles, pro-
bably took place about 1056-7 A.D. The king of Kambuja
who took Haripufijaya must have therefore ruled about
1036 A.D., and Ccedés therefore argues that he should he
identified with Siryavarman I. In support of his view that
Siryavarman was the son of the king of Siridhammanagara
or Ligor in Malay Peninsula, Coedés points out (1) that he
had no relationship with the preceding rnlers of Kambuja
viz. Jayavarman V and Udayadityavarman I; (2) that he
was the first Kambuja king to assume the title Kamtvan
which is derived from the Malay word iuan (chief); (3) that
he was a follower of Buddhism of which Siridhammanagara
(also called Nagara-Sri- Dharmaraja) was a_ stronghold;

raja had conquered Lavo (Lopburi) and it is from this town
that the king of Kambuja proceeded to invade Haripuii-
jaya; and (5) that the earliest Khmer inscriptions found at
Lopburi belong to the time of Siryavarman.

Coedés’ view is undoubtedly very ingenious and seduc-
tive, but is open to some very serious objections. In the
first place, although many of the records of Stiryavarman,
as noted above, refer to his connection with the old ruling
families of Kambuja, not the least reference is made any-
where to the fact that his father was a ruling prince. It
may be argued that the court-poets did not like to refer
to his foreign origin, but this could have hardly prevented
them from dilating on his royal family, at least in a general
- way. Secondly, as Coedés has himself pointed out, the
early records of Siryavarman all come from the north-
eastern region while those of his rival Jayaviravarman be-
long to the Angkor region in the west.’ This shows that he
first established his power in the eastern regions and
had no authority in the west. -This is hardly compatible
with the view that he was the son of a local ruler in Malay
Peninsula and must have therefore presumably invaded
Kambuja from the west. Besides, we must remember that
Camadevivamsa is not a historical work and its statements
must be accepted with caution. Further, the date of the in-
vasion of Haripufijaya: by the king of Kambuja, arrived at
by piecing together a large number of scattered data in
the chronicles cannot be fully relied upon. On the whole,
therefore it is difficult to regard Coedés’ view as anything
more than a mere tentative hypothesis.

3. Social and religious activities.

Siryavarman had a great leaning towards Buddhism,
for his inscriptions contain invocation to Buddha along with
that to Siva and his. posthumous name was Nirvana-pada.
He issued edicts containing regulation about monasteries in

14 BEPEO., Vol. XXXIV, p. 424
TSN SE ARTES on Ls igs a

KING SURYAVARMAN I OF KAMBUJA 143

which it is laid down that the ascetics and Buddhist monks
should offer to the king the merits of their piety.’* But
although he. might have adopted the Buddhist faith, he did
not give up the official Saiva creed and constructed both
Saiva and Vaisnava temples.

The Pra Khan Ins.'* contains the following verse about
Siiryavarman ‘——

‘‘Bhasyadi-carana kdvya-panis = sad-darganendriya /

YV anmatir-dharmmaédastradi-mastaka jangamayata/ |

This refers to the king’s proficiency iw Bhasya, Kavya,
Six Systems of Indian Philosophy and Dharmagastra. Other
records refer to his ‘knowledge of Atharvaveda, Yoga and
Panini’s Grammar. Even allowing for the exaggeration of
the court-poet, we may regard Siiryavarman as a learned
scholar. This intimate acquaintance with the orthodox
Hindu Hterature probably led him to initiate some social
reforms. The Prea Kev Ins. contains the following verse
about him :— | ~~

‘*64-Saryyavarmmano rajye varnnabhage krtepi yah/

Sarnpadarh praépya sad-bhaktya varnna-sresthatva-

sarnsthitah/ /

The expression ‘varnnabhdge krte’ literally means that
he instituted the system of caste. But this view is hardly
acceptable. For we get reference to castes in Kambuja
from a much earlier period. Even Jayavarman V, who
reigned shortly before, is said to have made, like Brahma,
proper arrangements of varnna and dérama (dhdteva var-
nndgrama-sad-vyavastham kriva). Stryavarman, therefore,
regulated the details of the caste system. Although we

have no knowledge of exactly what he did, we may well

believe that this king, versed in Hindu Sastras, tried to
introduce more orthodox rules in society, and confer dis-

tinction on worthy persons by placing them in higher social
ranks."°

His fondness for innovation is also seen in the domain
of art. He is’said to have completed the Hemagiri and the
Temple-mountain, two structures begun by his predecessors.
lt is very likely that these two are respectively the Ta Kev
temple and the Phimanakas, and Siryavarman added to
them the peculiar corbelled galleries which were unknown
in Kambuja architecture till then.”

On the whole Siryavarman is a remarkable figure in
Kambuija history, having a romantic career and a distingu-
ished personality. He had found Kambuja in a hopeless
state of disintergration, torn by civil war and suffering all
the miseries of anarchy and confusion. During his long
rule extending over nearly half a century (1001-1049 A.D.)
he restored peace and prosperity and extended the boun-
dary of Kambuja to the heart of Siam. The oath of
allegiance which he introduced as noted before, is taken
even today by the royal officials of Kambuja in more or
less the same terms. He made a deep impression on
posterity, and it is curious to note that the historical chroni-
cles of Cambodia place his name at the head of the list of
kings with which they begin. —

Ins. that the Brahmana Sivacdrya was placed at the head of his caste.

Abeyadana and Patothamya, two interesting

ternmples at Pagan

By S. K. Saraswati

In a study of the square temples at Pagan I have tried to
divide them into three distinct groups, which, however, are
found to belong to one common architectural tradition that
may be styled as Indo-Burmese.* Related to the first group,
represented by the famous Ananda and several other _ 1
similar examples, there are particularly two interesting
monuments, each of which, though with marked affinities”
with the Ananda group in respect of its plan, arrangement
and main lines of elevation, exhibits one distinct variety in
the shape of the crowning superstructure. While every
temple at Pagan, irrespective of the group to which it
belongs, is characterised by a curvilinear Sikhara over a
roof of several receding tiered stages, these two are each
distinguished by a stiipa over the tiered roof. This feature
constitutes a significant variation, which necessitates a
closer examination of these two monuments, especially as
regards their antecedents and possible analogues.

_ The Patothamya, alleged to have been built by king
Taungthuggyi in the early part of the 10th century A.D., and
the Abeyadana, built by the famous Kyanzittha in 1059
A.D., represent the two monuments, that are being referred
to here. A proper understanding of the monuments in
question along with the various problems regarding their
origin and antecedents requires a detailed. description of
these two singular examples of Burmese architecture. The
description given previously may here be reproduced in
full. As an architectonic example, we should remember,
the Abeyadana appears to have been anterior to the

1 JGIS,, Vol. IX; 1942, pp. 5-28 and pls.

146 S, K, SARASWATI

Patothamysa, which, according to the current tradition, has
been ascribed to an earlier date. It “‘represents a square
structure, raised on a moulded plinth, with a projecting
vestibule on one side having entrance doorways on three
sides of it. The vestibule is partitioned into a central nave
and two side aisles and in the interior of the main square
we have the usual circumambulatory corridor, surrounding
the solid masonry pile in the centre and lighted with the
help of three perforated windows, surmounted by flam-
boyants, on each of the three sides. In plan thus the
present structure closely resembles the Nanpaya and the
Nagayon, previously mentioned. Like them too the roof
rises in two ogee-shaped tiers directly over the vaults over
the corridors, surmounted further by three flat horizontal
tiers as the basement for the crowning element. The last,
however, presents a variation, not found in any of the,
monuments mentioned above. Instead of the curvilinear
gikhara, usual in such structures, we have the bell-shaped
dome of a siiipa, complete with the cruciform turret of the
harmmikd and the conical finial of the chatravali, as the
crowning member of the entire monument. In shape and
appearance it closely resembles the bell-shaped stipa
monuments of Burma. Each of the ogee-shaped roofs is
adorned with a miniature replica of the stiipa at each
corner, while the main entrance doorway in front of the
projecting vestibule is crowned likewise by a similar stipa
shrine. The roof of the vestibule as well as those of the
main shrine are lined each with a battlemented parapet at
each stage. The Patothamya resembles the Abeyadana in
general arrangement and composition. But the superstruc-
ture consists of flat roofs, instead of the ogee-shaped ones,
in the lower courses and a ten-sided dome with a corres-
ponding harmmiké and a conical chatravali as the crowning
element. The plan also exhibits signs of elaboration and
apart from the long projection of the portico on the front
side there is a shallow offset projection in the centre of each
of the three other sides: accommodating a rectangular door-
ABEYADANA AND PATOTHAMYA 147

way: A miniature square turret appears at each corner of
the different stages of the superstructure, as well as at the
centre of each stage, corresponding to the projection of the
vestibule and those of the shallow offsets. The parapet
at each stage of the roof is lined with a frieze of stiipa
replicas, instead of battlements. Barring these variations,
which might have been due to gradual elaboration in course
of time, the Abeyadana and the Patothamya resemble each
other closely and must be classed as belonging to the same
-type of monuments. They differ from the Nanpaya-
Nagayon-Ananda group only in the shape of the crowning
superstructure. In plan, in composition and in the main
lines of elevation both the groups represent the same con-
ception and the Abeyadana and the Patothamya, each with
its bell-shaped sfiipa as the crowning element, should be
regarded asa sub-variety of the Nanpaya-Nagayon~Ananda
group, which has a curvilinear éikhara instead.’

Except these two, no other temple, among the hundreds
that still stand at Pagan in various stages of preservation,
exhibit this kind of superstructure, which may, on this
account, be regarded as a singular feature. The characteris-
tic style of the Pagan temple may also be found reproduced
in relief on a number of terracotta votive tablets, discovered
from Pagan itself, as well as on a stone sculpture and
a terracotta votive tablet from Hmawza or the site of the
old city of Prome. In none of. these can we discern the
stiipa as the crowning superstructure of the temple, such
as we have in the Abeyadana and the Patothamya. A
stiipa raised over a series of graually receding terraces is,
however, a common feature of Burmese architecture and
such a stiipa is known as the Zediin Burma. But the stapa
as the crowning superstructure of a temple raised over a
gradually receding tiered roof can on no account be associa
ted or confused with the zedi, i-e., the. stiipa raised overa
terraced basement. So as far as our present knowledge goes,

2 JGIS., Vol. IX, pp. 13-15, Pl. IV.

148 S. K. SARASWATI

the Abeyadana and the Patothamya appear to have been
without a parallel in Burmese architecture.

Though no exact replica of the Abeyadana-Patothamya
type of temple is known, a structural analogue, at least
in exterior elevation, may be found in the small but exqui-
sitely charming temple of Chandi Pavon in the Kedu plain
in central Java.® In plan as well as in the internal arrange-
ment of the shrine the Pavon offers striking divergences
from the Abeyadana-Patothamya type. It consists of a
square (cruciform) cella on a wide basement. The cella
is surmounted, however, by a roof of two receding tiers
and is crowned by a bell-shaped siiipa, supported ona
cruciform platform and with the conical chatrdvali as the
finial. This stiipa is further surrounded by smaller stipas
on the second tiered stage, at the corners as well as in the
centre of each side. It will thus be seen that, in spite of
wide differences, the Chandi Pavon in Java reproduces
-in the external arrangement of its roof the prominent
characteristics of the Abeyadana-Patothamya type of temple
at Pagan in Burma.

From the simplicity of its design and from the style of
carvings the Chandi Pavon cannot be dated later than the
8th century A.D. and thus antedates the Burmese monu-
ments by at least 2 or 3 centuries. But this is the single
instance of such a kind of temple in the whole of Java, and
one solitary sample, though earlier, cannot indicate this
island as the source or origin of the peculiar type of monu-
ments in Burma, especially when we notice wide diver-
gences between the Burmese and Javanese specimens in
many fundamental points. It has already been shown that,
in spite of differences in detail, all the square temples at
Pagan; including the Abeyadana. and the Patothamya,
form a class by themselves, and that in external elevation
and appearance, viz. a roof of several tiered stages being
ultimately crowned by “a superstructure, either a sikhara

me

ABEYADANA AND PATOTHAMYA 149

or a stipa, they might ultimately be traced to North-Eastern
India. In Bengal and Eastern India there have been
discovered a number of stone sculptures, each with the
representation in relief of a temple. the roof of which rises
in several gradually diminishing tiered stages and witha
curvilinear gikhara on the top of it as the crowning super-

structure. A similar type of temple. may also be found

illustrated in several miniature paintings contained in a
manuscript of the Astasa@hasrikad Prajfidpadramita (Cambridge
Mss. Add. 1643), dated 135 Nepalese era, corresponding to
1015 A.D.* They illustrate several shrines in different parts
of Eastern India, which had already attained celebrity by
the time this manuscript was copied. These replicas of
temples on sculptures and in manuscript paintings, which
tally closely with those on the votive tablets from Pagan,

indicate a fair popularity of such a type of temple in

Eastern India and a fragmentary example of the type may
perhaps be recognised in the colossal temple at Paharpur
in the district of Rajshahi in North Bengal. The points of
contact as well as those of divergences between the
Burmese temple and the Indian one had been analysed in
detail before, but it cannot be doubted that the Indian
prototype had a great deal of influence on the evolution
of the characteristic monuments of Pagan.-

The Abeyadana and the Patothamya, though included
within the characteristic style of the Pagan temples, exhibit
a singular feature, namely a stipe over the tiered roof,
for which we have no other parallel i in Burmese architec-
ture. It should be pointed out in this connection that a
miniature stiipa as the pinnacle or the summit of a Buddhist
temple is nothing new. Being symbolic. of the faith it was
used as the finial of a Buddhist shrine, just as the cakra
(discus) or the trigdla (trident) is placed on the summit of
a temple of Visnu or of Siva. As such its use is very
common and frequent both in India and Farther India. In

150 S. K. SARASWATI

the Abeyadana and the Patothamya the case is, however,
different. Here, in each case, the stiipa is a part of
the structure itself and not merely its crowning finial.
Herein lies its singular interest, which adds to the unique-
ness of the monuments in question.

The Dravida style of temple in Southern India is charac-
terised by a pyramidal elevation of the tower (vimana),
which originally consisted of a multiplication of storey after
storey, eacha replica of the sanctum cella and _ slightly
reduced in extent than the one below, and of a domical
member, technically known as the stipi or sttipikd, as the
crowning member of the whole edifice.” Some scholars may
find an analogy between the stipa surmounting the tiered
toof of the Abeyadana-Patothamya type of temple at
Pagan and the octagonal or hemispherical dome crowning
the storeyed stages of the Dravida temple. But this ana-
logy fails to bear closer scrutiny. The domical crowning
member of the Dravida temple might have some superficial
resemblance with the hemispherical shape of the st@pa and
may account for the technical term stipi or stipika. But it
should be remembered that the term siipi is also used in
Silpa texts to mean merely the top of the tower, whatever its
shape might be, as in the case of the Nagara temples.°
Moreover, the stipi or stiipika crowning the Dravida temple
lacks the essential component elements of the stiipa proper
and cannot be legitimately identified or equated with one.
The octagonal or hemispherical dome crowning the pyra-
midal roof of the Dravida temple-style cannot be cited
hence as an instance analogous to that of the Abeyadana-
Patothamya oer of. Femple.

ABEYADANA AND PATOTHAMYA 151

The association of the Pagan style of temple as a main
class with Eastern India has been possible on the analogy of
the relief representations of temples of the Pagan style on
tablets and sculptures from Pagan and Prome in Burma with
similar replicas that have been found on several stone sculp-
tures in Eastern India. But in none of these do we find the
. Abeyadana-Patothamya type represented and one is apt
to regard it as only a local and indigenous manifestation
of the main style, this main style being indebted for many ah
of its fundamental characteristics to inspiration from Eas- ai
tern India. But no other structural example of the type,
except these two, is known in the whole of Burma, nor is
the type represented on any of the numerous votive tablets
from Pagan bearing in relief the models of the Pagan st¥le
of temple. For a prototype of the Abeyadana and the
Patothamya one has to search the region nearer to the
place, whence the original inspiration for the fundamentals
of the style came. But neither in the Eastern provinces,
nor in any part of India do we find a monument that may
approximate, even superficially, the Abeyadana-Pato-
thamya type of temple.

The Cambridge manuscript of the Astasdhasrika Prajfia-
4 pGramita (Add. 1643), mentioned above, is of extreme
) importance to the student of Indian architecture as handing

down to us: remarkable sketches of many interesting types

of monuments that once adorned the different parts of
" India, but which have well nigh perished and passed into

oblivion. Among its miniatures there are representations
of famous Buddhist shrines in India, specially Eastern India.
Some of these represent interesting architectura] types,
4 of which not only no extant examples are known, but
) even the memory has completely been forgotten. One
such type has already been taken note of, namely the tem-
ple with the tiered. roof crowned bya curvilinear gikhara,
such as we have on the stone sculptures from’ Eastern India
and votive tablets and sculptures. from Pagan and Prome
in Burma. There are at least three representations of such

52 5. K. SARASWATI

a type among the painted miniatures,’ which indicate a
fairly frequent usage of the type in ancient days, though
not a single example of it appears to exist now. These
sketches, coupled with similar relief replicas on  sculp-
tures and tablets from Eastern India and Burma, furnish
a forgotten, but, nonetheless, important chapter in the
history of Indian as well as Farther Indian architecture.
' Still more interesting are the three sketches, represent-
ing respectively the shrines of Lokanatha in Nalendra
(Bengal),* of Vaisali Tara in Tirabhukti (North Bihar)*® and
of Vajrapani in Uddiyana.’® The location of the last is
unknown, but there is a volume of evidence in favour of
its being situated in Bengal '* Dr. Benoytosh Bhattacharyya
is inclined to identify it with Vajrayogini, a famous centre
of Tantrik worship in the district of Dacca.’* These ske-
tches, all evidently from Eastern India, represent a signi-
ficant type of building that was in vogue in this region in
the ancient days, but every vestige of which had long been
wiped out. Not only there are not a single extant example,
but what is more, even relief representations of such a
kind of building, suck as ive) have ferthe other forgotten
type, are lacking. These sketches are hence the only
records of the existence of such a type of building in Eastern
India in days long gone by.

Of the three shrines those at Uddiyana and Tirabhukti
_ appear to represent an earlier form. In each of these
we find a temple, the roof of which rises in several gra-
dually receding, tiers and is surmounted by a fairly big
stiipa, complete with all its component elements. Some-

times the edge of the tiers is indented, a feature that adds
to the decorative effect of the shrine. A more evolved
and elaborate form of the type may be recognised in the
temple of Lokanadtha in Nalendra, where we find the cor-
ners at each stage decorated further with miniature repli-
cas of the crowning superstructure, i.e., the stiipa support-
ed on the last tier of the roof. Curious though such a
building may be, there can be no doubt that these sketches
were no inventions of imaginative artists, but were copied
from the actual shrines themselves, which had attained
sanctity and celebrity in those days. They appear to have
formed a significant architectural type that was in vogue
in Eastern India, especially in famous sites of old.

These sketches reproduce the typical characteristic of
the Abeyadana-Patothamya type of temple at Pagan, for
which we have no other parallel in Burma, either among
the numerous Pagan monuments nor among the relief
replicas that we posses of such monuments. The type,

however, was certainly in existence in Eastern India before |

the manuscript was copied, i.e., before 1015 A.D. The
Pagan style in its fundamental aspects may ultimately be
traced to Eastern India. The Abeyad&na and the Pato-
thamya clearly demonstrate that even in the determining
of types and varieties within the style of Pagan temples
Eastern Indian architectural tradition played a significant
and dominant part.*

A Note on the expression, Sat-tarka in
an Inscription of Champa

By Durca CHARAN CHATTERJEE

& Po-Nagar inscription? of King Indravarman Ill of
Champa dated 840 Saka (=918 A.D.) in connection with
the installation of an image of the goddess Bhagavati by
him, describes the scholarship of the king as follows:

mimdams4a-sat-tarka-jinendra-sarmis

sakasika-vyakaranodakaughah

akhyGna-ésaivottara-kalpa-minah

Here the expression mimamsa-sat-tarka has been translat-
ed® as ‘the six systems of Philosophy beginning with
Mimamsa’, it being obviously interpreted as mimdmsddi-
sat-tarka. By the six systems of Philosophy we often
understand the six Brahmanical schools of thought usually
known as (1) Mimamsa, (2) Vedanta, (3) Nydya, (4) Vaige-
sika, (6) Sa@mkhya and (6) P&tafijala. The six systems as des-
cribed by the Jaina scholar Haribhadrasiiri in his Saddar-
Sanasamuccaya* are (1) Bauddha, (2) Jaina, (3) Nyaya, (4)
Vaisesika, (5) Samkhya and (6) Mimamsa. It is interesting to
note that all these six systems have been regarded as Gstika
by Haribhadra. He further observes that Nyadya and

Vaisesika do form but one school and Carvaka known as
ndstika (unbeliever) should, therefore, be incorporated in
the group in order to have the six systems of thought. The
word tarka is sometimes used in a specific sense, as in the
Nydyasiitra,’ and sometimes in the general sense of ‘argu~
ment’ or ‘discussion’®.' But is there any authority for use
of the word sat-tarka to denote the six systems of Indian
Philosophy as they are commonly recognised >”

Rajagekhara (c. 1000 A.D.) in his Kdavya-mimamsa

divides adnviksiki into piirva-paksa and uttara-paksa, the —

former comprising the schools of (i) Bauddha, (ii) Jaina,
and (iii) Carvdka, and the latter consisting of the schools
of (iv) Nydya, (v) Vaigesika, and (vi) Samkhya. And these
six systems have been designated by him as sat-tarka.*®
Elsewhere in this work,® RajaSekhara has divided the Pra-
manikas or the experts in the pramdna-vidyG into two classes
—Mimamsikas and Tarkikas, the latter being further classi-
and Vaiéesika (Nydya-Vaisesikiya), (iv) Bauddha (Bauddh-
iya), (v) Jaina (Arhata), and (vi) Cadrodka (Lokdyatika).
Jayantabhatta (c. 1000 A.D.) uses the Seprestion sat-tarka
in his Nyaya-mafjan precisely in the same sense.’

We thus find that sat-tarka has come to be used ina
specific sense about 1000 A.D. As occurring in an ins-
cription of the same period, it should therefore be taken
in the sense of the six logical systems of (1) Bauddha- (2)
Jaina, (3) Carodka, (4) S@mkhya, (5) Nyaya and (6) Vaiée-
sika. The expression mima&msa-saf-tarka can be interpre-
ted as mimdGmsd and gat-tarka. Mimdmsd, as it is well-
known, refers to both Karmamimamsa and Jhdnamimaémsa
or Vedanta. Similarly Saémkhya includes both the atheis-
tic school of Kapila and the theistic school of Patafijali
(Patafijala or Yoga system). It is, therefore apparent that
in the inscription mentioned above mimadmsd and _ sgat-tarka
taken together stand for all the commonly known schools
of Indian Philosophy both Brahmanical and non-Brahmani-
cal, or at least for the logical portions of those schools: they
also cover the entire range of Pramanavidyd which Raja-
gekhara recommends for a poet."* King Indravarman Ill of the
Champ4 inscription who has been described as one expert
as much in abstruse philosophy and grammar as in imagina~
tive poetic art, appears to have followed just what is pres-
cribed by Rajasekhara, possibly his contemporary in India.

idam=eva tarka-nyayavistara-Sabdabbyam Sastram-uktam, The state-
ment of Jayanta may be summarised as follows: The techniques of
inference, of the (i) Samkhya, (ii) Jaina and (iii) Buddhist schools do
not appear satisfactory and neither are they helpful for establishing
the authority of the Veda. The logic of the (iv) Carvaka is ridicu-
lously defective and can hardly claim any consideration. The
Vaisesika being just in agreement with the (vi) Nyaya position,

Wayfarer's Words, Vol. II]. By Mrs. C.A:F. Rhys
Davids, D.Litt., M.A. London 1941. Pp. 373-719.

It is with a heavy heart that we take up our pen to
review the exceedingly thoughtful work of a savant who is
no more in this world, This work is the second volume
of Mrs. Rhys Davids’ sporadic writings and lectures (nos.
31-60). Of late Mrs. Rhys Davids has been harping on
the theme that Buddha’s Buddhism was first distorted by
the Pali commentators, particularly by Buddhadatta and
Buddhaghosa and then by the present day orientalists,
many of whom missed the real sense of a Pali word.
Much harm has been done, she says, to the true com-
prehension. of Buddhism by the careless rendering of Pali
words and expressions into an European language. There
is much force in this remark but the stumbling-block is
that to write on Buddhism, one must use some European
language’ as his medium of expression. Mrs. Rhys Davids
herself has started using new words and even coining
some for this purpose. She rejected some of the hack-
neyed words used in translations and ‘substituted others
which would give more sense, e.g. Buddha= Pioneer (p. 473},
Waywitter (p. 474), tanhd=strong will (p. 481), brahma-
cariya=the God-life (p.492), aita=Man in the mind (not
“‘self’’ used by. Oldenberg and Rhys Davids, pp. 448-
450), and so forth. The favourite style of expression
adopted by Mrs. Rhys Davids is as follows: ‘‘And this
was just the object of Sakyan mission; its emphasis lay,
not on the Most, Highest, Best, but on the More, the
Way in which man could become that More, the carrying out
religion, notin ritual, not in assertion of identity with the
Highest, but in so living as to be growing,  fructifying i in that
More on the way to the Most’’. (p. 420).

. The above extract . ‘gives: an. 1 idea not only at her style

8 NOTICES OF BOOKS

of writing but also the substance of her new interpretation
of original Buddhism. She is of opinion that Buddha took
the doctrine of immanence from’the Upanisads, but he did
not recommend the practice of introspection leading to the
identification of the self with the Highest, (the ‘‘Most’’ of
Mrs. Rhys Davids); he recommended a gradual purification
and spiritual uplift, in the words of the authoress he
laid emphasis on the ‘“‘More’’ which, of course, would
ultimately lead to the ‘‘Most,’’ the Brahman of the Upani-
sads (p. 602). Buddha, she states, accepted the principle
of immanence in Brahmanism of that day, but he rejected
the rituals and laid emphasis on conduct, and ultimately, the
difference between Brahmanism and Buddhism became
widened in the conception of ‘‘atman’’ which in the Upani-
sads meant “‘best self,’’ in Buddhist texts ‘something non-
existent,’’ while in Christianity ‘‘our worse self’’ (p. 608).
Through all these lectures and writings of late Mrs, Rhys
Davids has harped on the theme that Nirvana originally did
not mean either annihilation or a state of peace and rest and
happiness; it was the state of immanence ‘‘the teaching
man how, as wayfarer in the worlds he might, seeking his
aitha, finally become That’”’ (p. 658). In fact, she has
been drifting towards Mahayanic interpretation of Nirvana,
i.e. Tathata=Thatness, though she says that in “Mahayana
the cult of words begat a metaphysic of absolutism’”’
while in Hinayana (Theravada) the cult of words begat
some psychology and logic. In both the founder asa real
man, and his real gospel, were practically lost sight of
(p. 705)."’ By forceful reasoning, she wants to estab-
lish that Buddha was never antitheistic. Her conclusion is
that ‘Buddhism at its birth was in a fair, true way theistic
than other world creeds’’ (p. 451).

In this review we have tried ‘to attente the lines in
which Mrs. Rhys Davids wanted to intrepret Buddhism
Jately. She has in fact rejected several pet theories of
the Palists. She boldly asserts that Buddhism is a reorien-
tation of the Upanisadic teaching, that Buddha was more

Sal oat RR
NOTICES OF BOOKS 159

theistic than any other teacher, and that his Nirvana was
nothing but the Upanisadic doctrine of Immanence. In
conclusion we may say that this new approach to the prob-
lem of Buddhist philosophy should be seriously taken up
by the Palists, because there is much force in it as it has
come from one who can claim to be one of the greatest
Palists of the present day and perhaps the first and the fore-
most in the studies of Pali Abhidhamma. She has, however,
unconsciously drifted towards Mahayana, and accepted the
claim of the Mahayanists that the Hinayadnic interpretations
were superficial. After all, the lectures and writings are
thought-provoking and we hope these will be read in the
spirit they are written.

The Successors of the Satavahanas in Lower Decsan. By
‘Dines Chandra Sircar, M. A.; Ph.D. Published by the
Calcutta University. Pp. xv+417. Calcutta 1939,

This is a contribution of first-rate importance to the study
of the dynasties that ruled in the lower Deccan in the
interval between the downfall of the Sdtavahanas and the
Calukya conquest. In his attempt to reconstruct the regional
history of the period in question, the author has frequently
had occassion to tackle numerous problems of genealogy,
chronology and geography, to correct errors of former
workers inthe field, and to explain a number of technical
terms and expressions occurring in the inscriptions such as
ayukta, vallabha, neyika-naiyogika; hiranyagarbhodbhav-
odbhava, avasitavividha-divya and so forth. His discussions
are marked not only by a high degree of technical equip-
ment including a thorough knowledge of palaeography and
of the relevant general literature, but also by sound judg-

ment and they are always expressed in a clear incisive
style. In the result he. has not only laid a sound basis for
the political history of an important tract in the first few
centuries of the Christian era, but has: also presented

illuminating side-lights on its administration and the state
of contemporary society and religion.

The work under notice consists of two Parts. In Part |
(chs. I-VI) the author deals successively with the history
of the Iksvakus, the Brhatphalayanas, the Anandas, the
Salankadyanas, the Visnukundins and the Early Pallavas
who ruled the Andhra country in the period in question.
Part I] (chs. I-IV) reviews the history of the different
branches of the Early Kadambas and of the Kekayas who
ruled the Kanarese country during the same period. The
author has earned the thanks of his readers by including
a map at the beginning of his work and by adding ten
valuable Appendices and a good Index at its end.

We have noticed a few printing mistakes not corrected
in the list of Addenda et Corrigenda at the end, such as

In this well-documented and scholarly work, which

Archives and the Colombo Museum as well as printed
records of Parlimentary debates, old Journals, contempo-
rary works and the like. The author's analysis of historical
causes and effects is sound and penetrating, his style is
clear and effective, his critical observations are suggestive
and stimulating. We can best illustrate our remarks in
this last respect by making a few quotations. Commenting
upon the fall of the last independent king of Kandy, the
author writes (pp. 156-57):—‘‘A petty state, mediaeval in
structure, unprogressive in ideas, parochial in policy and
diplomacy and rent by internal dissensions, could not any-
how have checked the advance of a modern imperial power.
...But the extraordinary ease with which the British conquest
of Kandy was accomplished in a campaign of only forty
days excites remark. It is to be ascribed to the disloyalty
of the entire body of chiefs and the disaffection of the
common people....lt was a repetition of an old and tragic
tale. The Kandyans turned with a too facile readiness to
the idea of bringing in the foreigner to settle their domestic
differences. That pitcher went once too often to the well.
The convenient arbitrator became the permanent master.
The Kandyans accomplished their own political doom.”
Again, in bringing his narrative to a close with the fateful

‘year 1833—the date itself is a reminder of the close parallel

between modern Indian and Sinhalese history—the author
observes (p. 594): —‘“*‘The year 1833 constitutes a definite
and important landmark in the history of Ceylon. After
centuries of war, disruption and disunion, the Island had
been completely pacified, politically united and administra-
tively consolidated under the British sceptre. The rulers
of Ceylon could now turn unhindered, witha reorganised
and modernised administration, to. the task of opening up
the Island and developing its resources... In short, the
foundations of the present political, administrative and
economic structure of Ceylon were laid during the period
1796-1833, and the reforms. of 1833. ‘completed and rounded

Annual Bibliography of Indian History and Indology,
vol. Il for 1939. By Braz A. Fernandes. Published by the
Bombay Historical Society, Bombay 1941. Pp. xxii+ 191.
Price Rs. 5/.

In recent times the two well-known series of publications,
the Annual Bibliography of Indian Art and Archaeology
and the Bibliographie Bouddhique published respectively by
the Kern Institute of Leyden and a Committee of scholars
with J. Przyluski and M. Lalou at its head, have been of
immense service for the cause of Indological and allied
studies. It was a matter of extreme regret to all concerned
that these two useful series ceased publication in 1939 and
1937 respectively. It speaks much for the enterprise and
love of scholarship of the Bombay Historical Society that
it was able almost at once to step into the breach by publish-
ing a Bibliography of Indian History and Research for 1938
as a Supplement to its well-known Journal. ‘The present
volume marks a fresh step in advance as it is published
independently with an improved arrangement. It consists of
five sections bearing the titles (1) India, Burma and Ceylon
(il) Further India and Indonesia (II) Adjoining countries
(IV) Islamic world and (V): Miscellaneous. The first and
by far the longest section (134 pp.) is divided into'a number
of sub-sections under appropriate headings Each Section or
Sub-section gives the author’s name in alphabetical order
along with the titles of the books and references and in
some cases short notices of contents. An Index of Authors
and a Subject Index brings this useful volume to a close.

In a work of this compass it is easy to pick up defects
such as the over-lapping of topics, the omission of impor-
tant names and the meagre notices of contents of even
important books and articles. We have noticed a few

duplications (e.g. nos. 783 and 812) and a number of print-
ing mistakes (such as those under nos. 249, 254, 286, 321,
342, 348, 455 and 746). We have no doubt that with wider
experience and with closer co-operation of scholars and
learned institutions, the Annual Bibliography of Indian
History and Indology will overcome all such defects. We
wish the new venture a long and prosperous career.

Early History of the Andhra Country. By K. Gopala-
chari, M. A.. Ph.D. Madras University Historical Series
No. 16. Published by the University of Madras, 194l. Pp.
xiv +226 and 12 plates. Price Rs. 5/8.

- This well-written monograph maintains the high standard

of scholarship that we have been used to expect from the
series of historical publications issued by the Madras
University under the inspiring and skilled guidance of Prof.
K. A. Nilakanta Sastri. As the author tells us in his short
Preface, ‘‘It is an attempt to present a connected history
of the Andhras and the Andhra country from the earliest
times to the advent of the Eastern Calukyas.”” In accord-
ance with this plan the author first deals (chs. I-VI}, as
exhaustively- as the scanty materials will permit, with the
much discussed but still far from certain, history of the
Sstavahanas. In the following chapters (VII- -XI) he traces
with equal ability the less known history of the dynasties
following the Satavahanas in the Telugu country, viz: the
Iksvakus, the Brhatphalayanas, the. Vaingeyakas (usually
called Salankayanas), the Kandaras {usually known as
Anandas) and the Visnukundins. Over and above his recons-
truction of the dynastic history, the author has presented
in each case valuable notices of the conditions of govern-
ment, society and religion prevailing i in those times.

Presented as a University Doctorate thesis, the present
work bears on every page the stamp of ripe scholar-
ship. The author's use of his. ‘SOUrces, extending to a

8

64 NOTICES OF BOOKS

minute and painstaking examination of the epigraphic,
numismatic and literary data, is thorough and exhaustive.
What is more, his treatment of numerous difficult and
disputed questions of history, geography and chronology is
marked by critical acumen of a high order.

We propose to offer a few remarks for the consideration
of the author in the event of a new edition being called for.
The notices of administrative arrangements of the Sata-
vahana and other dynasties should: include an account of
the prevailing land system. It was pointed out by the pre-
sent reviewer in another connection (Agrarian System in
Ancient India, pp. 34-37) that the records of the Satavahanas
and their contemporaries and immediate successors in the
Deccan and South India testify to the extraction of revenve
from the royal farms and allotments in villages, the land
revenue in the proper sense of the term being probably as
yet unknown. In the chapters on social conditions the
author's notes on dress and ornaments, luxury, military
arrangement etc. (pp. 98-104) should be amply illustrated
by sketches from the monumental sculptures somewhat on
the lines of Mr. C. Sivaramamurti’s recently published fine
monograph Amaravati Sculptures in the Madras Museum.
The section ‘on economic conditions should similarly be
rendered more vivid by means of sketch-maps indicating the
ports, the: market towns, trade-routes etc. as far as ascer-
tainable. An attempt should also be made to trace as much
as possible the ratio between the different metallic curren-
cies of the Satavahanas, the purchasing power of the local
currency and so forth. A few misprints e.g. Kalimpur
(p- 148n) require correction. |

from the earliest times to the downfall of the Sena rule in
West Bengal at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the
thirteenth century A.D. On the many difficult and disputed
questions that crop up in the course of his narrative the

the significance of the title Brahmaksatriya (pp. 432-455),
the origin of the Laksmana Sena era (pp. 462-469) and the
chronology of the Senas (pp. 469-479).

In Part [I] the author attempts to give as far as possible
a connected account of the public administration of Bengal
from Maurya times to the end of Sena rule. In this con-
nection he deals adequately with such important topics as
the system of provincial, district and village administration
under the Imperial Guptas and their immediate successors
{pp. 490-521), the constitutional importance of the election
of Gopala I (pp. 525-528), the significance of administrative
titles (pp. 534-553) and the system of provincial, district
and village administration under the Palas and Senas as well
as minor dynasties (pp. 554-556).

We have noticed a few slips and omissions not referred to in
the list of Addenda et Corirgenda, which may be rectified in a
later edition. To the list of Bengal Inscriptions (pp. xi ff.)
should be added (1) and (2) two Midnapore Sahitya-Parisat
Museum copper-plate inscriptions of Saganka and (3) Naraya-
napur Image Inscription of Mahipala I (2). On p. 168 Jaugada
should be read in place of Jaugarh. On p- 173 in connection
with the discussion of the identity of the Yavana invader
of the Gangetic valley mention should be made of Dr. W.
W. Tarn’s notable theory in his work The Greeks and
Bactrians in India.’ On. p. 245 the supposed reference in
the Aphsad inscription of Adityasena to the slaying of
Damodaragupta in a battle with the Maukharis should be
corrected in the light of Prof. Ksetresa Chandra Chatto-
padhyaya’s explanation (D.R. Bhandarkar Volume, pp.

In the chapter on administration under the Palas and Senas
(p. 549) notice should be taken of the interpretation by the
present reviewer (Hindu Revenue System, pp- 219-220) of
the title DagaGparadhika which has been practically left

The Twelfth All-India Oriental Conference,
Benares

By Dr. Sunrrr Kumar’ CHATTER]I

The Twelfth All-India Oriental Conference took
place at Benares in the premises of the Benares Hindu
University under the auspices of the University on the
30th and 3lst December 1943 and the Ist and 2nd
January 1944. The conference is held every two years—the
last session was at Hyderabad, Deccan. This year the
General President was Rao Bahadur Dr. S. K. Belvalkar of
Poona, eminent Sanskritist of present-day India. There
were 14 sections for the different branches of Indology,
including a Pandita-Parishad or Gathering of Sanskrit
scholars of the old type which was presided over by
Mahamahopadhyaya Pandit Giridhar Sarma Chaturvedi,
Principal of the Maharaja's Sanskrit College, Jaipur. The
other Sections and Sectional Presidents were the following:
(1) Vedic—Dr. Kunhan Raja, Professor of Sanskrit, Madras
University; (2) Iranian, Dr. J. M. Unvala of Navsari;
(3) Islamic History and Culture, Dr. S. M. H. Nainar,
Madras University; (4) Arabic and Persian, Dr. M. Iqbal,
Oriental College, Lahore; (5) Sanskrit, Mahamahopadhyaya
Dey Pic Vi: Kane, Bombay; (6) Religion and Philosophy,
Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. Umesh Mishra, Allahabad Univer-
sity; (7) Pali and Buddhism, Dr. P. V. Bapat, Fergusson
College, Poona; (8) Prakrit and Jainism, Prof. Hiralal Jain,
Amraoti; (9) History and Geography, Dr. H. C. Ray,
~ Ceylon University; (10) Archaeology, Rao Bahadur C. R.
Krishnamacharlu, Superintendent of Epigraphy, Madras;
(11) Philology and Indian Linguistics, Dr. S. K. De, Dacca
University; (12) Technical Sciences, Prof. P. C. Das Gupta,
Calcutta; (13) Hindi, Rai Bahadur Dr. Shyamsundar Das,
Benares. It: has been decided to add a new section from
the ‘next session onwards, that on Dravidian Studies.
ALL-INDIA ORIENTAL CONFERENCE 169

There was quite a large attendance, all the Universities
and a great many learned bodies in India being represented,
and Benares as the intellectual centre of Hinduism naturally
attracted a good number of delegates. One delegate
represented China—Dr. F. K. Li (Li Fang-Kuci), who is a
distinguished linguistician of Modern China. Dr. Li was
sent by the Academia Sinica and the Sino-Indian Cultural
Association of Chung-king, and, in addition to attending
the Conference, Dr. Li intended to make a tour of India
and to form contacts with our scholars particularly in Indo-
logy and in Linguistics with a view to future collaboration
in scholarship relating to Sino-Indian and other cultural
matters, including linguistic investigation of Indian
languages of the Sino-Tibetan family. The visit of Dr. Li
was thus highly significant, and although foreign delegates
had attended the all-India Oriental Conference before, it
was the first time that we had an official representative from
our great neighbour China. It is hoped that the coming
of Dr. Lifrom China, combined with the interchange of
students between India and China which has already taken
place and with the interchange of professors which may be
arranged for in the near future, will usher in a new era of
Sino-Indian fellowship through. study and research into the
culture of Asia and Asiatic peoples—a prospect which the
Greater India Society cannot but contemplate with pleasure.
There are already some Chinese scholars and students
resident in Calcutta, at Santiniketan (in the Cina-bhavana,
an Institute of Chinese Research) and at Sarnath near
Benares, and in addition to Dr. Li, some of these scholars
from China (notably Mr. T. F. Chou, who is studying
Sanskrit and Indian languages in India) also attended.
There were two delegates representing Poland, Dr.

Maryla Falk ot Calcutta University, and Dr. Ludwic

Sternbach. Ne) ae. TNE .
The Conference was formally opened at 12 on the 31 et

December by the Pro-Chancellor of the University,

Maharajadhiraj: Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga in the

170 ALL-INDIA ORIENTAL CONFERENCE

Sayajirao Library Hall, after which Dr. Belvalkar read his
presidential address. The Pandita Parishad and _ the
different sections held their meetings, and over 200 papers
were contributed by scholars. There were three symposia
arranged in which distinguished specialists took part—
(1) Who overthrew the Kushana Empire—the Bharaégivas,
the Vdakétakas, or the Yaudheyas? (2) The Vikrama
Era (the present year, 1944, corresponds to year 2000
of the Vikrama Samvat, and in various places in India
celebrations of the commencement of the third millennium
of the Vikrama Era are being held, so that this subject had
a special topical interest in the present conference); (3) the
Data of the Mahabharata War; (4) the Authenticity of the
Bhadsa Plays; and (5) Hindi as the Lingua-Franca for India.
The last symposium was held under the joint auspices of
the Linguistic and Modern Indian Languages Section of the
Conference and the Linguistic Society of India, and as the
- subject had a very wide appeal, there was a large gathering
of both members of the Conference and of the public.
: The Linguistic Society of India employs the occasion of
the All-India Oriental Conference to hold its two-yearly
sittings, and this time also the Society held its session. The
report of the Society for the last two years was read by
the secretary, Dr. Sukumar Sen of the University of Calcutta,
and new  office-bearers were elected with Dr. Suniti
Kumar Chatterji as President. The Society brings out its
Quarterly Journal Indian Linguistics and seeks to constitute
an important forum for all higher linguistic work in India.
The papers contributed to the different sections were (as
naturally would be the. case) of diverse quality with a few
echoing fantastic theories and views, but there were some
important articles. The Aryan-and non-Aryan question is
coming larger and larger into prominence, and in Linguistics,
slowly the Indian investigators are extending the scope of
their researches into Indo-European. Topics of Greater
Indian interest were conspicuous by their absence, this
year, unfortunately. - There was a solitary paper on Relation
ALL-INDIA ORIENTAL CONFERENCE 171

between Bengal and China in Ancient Times by Dr. D.C.
Ganguli of Dacca University, together with another on

Early Arab Expeditions to India by Mr. M. A. Khaliq, —

M.A. of Delhi. We only wish that Indian scholars turned
their attention to this aspect of Indology, and devoted
greater attention to the question of Indian contacts with
other countries of Asia, particularly in ancient and medi-
eval times. )

The Conference, on the whole, was a great success,
both academically and socially. Apart from the papers and
learned lectures there was a lunch (vegetarian and purely
aL indienne) given by the Chancellor of the University, His
Highness the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, and At
Homes given by the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, by the
Nagari Pracdrini Sabha (Academy of Hindi Literature) of
Benares, and by Sir Vijaya of Vizianagram. Visits were

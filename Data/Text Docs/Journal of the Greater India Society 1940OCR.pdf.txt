The Buddhist Monastery of Fondukistan

By Dr. J. Hackin

The Buddhist monastery of Fondukistan, through its
statues and its mural paintings, furnishes a characteristic
illustration of the techniques of Central Asia arising from a
laborious adaptation of the very limited local resources to
the exigencies of a complex iconographic programme.
The modellings in unbaked earth mixed with straw crammed
with horse-hair and made firm by the pieces of wood cons-
tituting a veritable skeleton, filled the niches of the wall:
this last was covered with paintings laid on a plaster com-
posed of a mixture of earth and stuffed straw. This substi-
tution of clay statues for sculptures in schist and for orna-
ments in stucco so abundant in the north-west of India and
in the region of Jelalabad in Afghanistan, was already
noticed during the excavations carried out in June 1933 at
Teppé Marendjan on the western part of the hill of elon-
gated form which rises immediately to the east of Kabul.
One of the clay-modellings discovered at Teppé Marendjan*
deserves a very special mention. This statue which was

entirely painted was found in a niche of the west face of the
monastery which was completely concealed by a supporting
wall; the statue appeared nearly intact, the head alone
having been detached from the trunk because of a slight
falling-off of the vault of the niche. Siddhartha who is the
Bodhisattva here represented, is seated in the oriental
fashion, his hands joined in meditation. The torso, admi-
rably modelled, is of a very Indian suppleness, The face
with eyes half-closed, very elongated, and of very pronounc-
ed ophthalmia, likewise shows a marked Indianisation. The
coiffure was a turban provided with a circular median oma-
ment of large dimensions which we could compare with
those that adorn the coiffure of the Siddhartha of the
Peshawar Museum brought to light at Sahri Bablol.? The
clay-models of Teppé Marendjan and the sculpture in
schist from Peshawar are very closely related; the ornaments,
the vestments and the coiffures show very slight differences.
‘The rose-apple tree under which the Bodhisattva meditates
is depicted in the specimen of Sahri Bahlol by a falling-off of
the leaves; at Teppé Marendjan the leaves were partly
painted upon the vault of the niche and partly modelled and
laid on the wall. It is in the rendering of the anatomical
detail that the superiority of the clay-modelling shows itself.
To convince oneself of this, it will be sufficient to compare
the torsos of the two statues: on the one side suppleness
and elegance,’ on the other, rigidity and heaviness.
Reverting to Teppé Marendjan, we must observe that a
hiding-place discovered not far from the statue of Bodhi-
sattva Siddhartha contained gold and silver coins of the
third and fourth centuries of the Christian era, namely,
twelve gold coins of the style of Kishan Shah Sassanides,*

pieces), Shapir Ill, 383-388 A.D. (II pieces). It is not
without interest to note this fact. We shall return to it
again while we shall discuss the question of a find of coins
made at Fondukistan.

At Teppé Marendjan, we find ourselves for the first
time confronted with the general use of a technique very
different from those of which we observed the application
while studying the archzeological sites of ancient Gandhara
and the region of Jelalabad (echist and stucco). It should
be noted that at ancient Kapiéa to the north of Kabul the
sculptures in schist are very near the clay-modellings (exca~
vations at Paitiva, 1924, excavations at Shotorak, 1937), In
fact, it is only beyond Begram, towards Fondukistan and
Bamiyan that the techinque of clay-modelling becomes
universal : these two sites have not yielded a single sculpture
in schist.

Fringed by the terreous hills of rounded foldings, the
torrent of Fondukistan comes into the tortuous valley of
Ghorband from the east, almost at the entrance of the
large village of Siyahgird, situated 117 kilometres to the
north-west of Kabul and 128 kilometres to the west of
Bamiyan. From Siyahgird several paths lead towards the
village of Fondukistan which gives ite name to the valley
fertilised by the waters of the torrent. On the right bank
of the water-course the most frequented path rises by a
steep ascent without intermediate steps up to a vast ruined
qaleh.’ This preliminary effort is without any fresh ascent;
having crossed several fields regularly sown with wheat and
barley, the path reaches a zone where the arborial vegeta-
tion becomes quite dense. Mulberry-trees, apricot-trees
and almond-trees give a cool shade in midsummer. The

other paths, while they do not require the initial efforts
of a steep climb, offer the inconvenience of being encum-
bered, as the bed of the torrent is very near, with pebbles
and even with big stones. It is only in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of Fondukistan (nearly 5 kilometres from the
village of Siyahgird) that these paths rising by stages finish
with those to which we have made allusion.

As soon as the visitor, passing along the principal path,
has crossed the steep ascent and the ruins of the qaleh, he
perceives in the southern direction a conical hill which seems
to enclose the valley; in fact, it commands the narrow pas-
sage by which the torrent and the path creep their way. In
approaching this hill, one observes that it attaches iteelf
by a narrow promontory to the group of heights which
from the westem boundary of the valley; it is there that
one notices the vestiges of the construction crowning the
summit of this hill. (fg. 1).

No information concerning Fondukistan reached us
before September 1936. I did not know at that time that
Fondukistan had been mentioned as early as 1836 by the
English traveller Charles Masson in a second memoir on the
ancient coins found at Begram (Beghram) in the Kohistan
of Kabul. Here is the passage concerning Fondukistan :*

“In the district of Ghorband, west of the great hill-range, which,
radiating from the Hinda-Kosh or Caucasus, forms the Western boun-
dary of Koh Daman, we have very many important vestiges of
antiquity, both in the principal valley and in its dependencies, parti-
cularly in one of them named Fondukistan: we have reasons to believe
that coins are found there in considerable numbers and that there are
some interesting mounds; but as we have not seen this spot, we refrain
from speculating upon its character.”

It was while completing our documentation on Begram
in 1938 that this interesting pasage revealed Fondukistan to

us. Our discoveries at Fondukistan’ show to what’ extent the
account given by our predecessor was worthy of. being
retained.

When ‘in. September 1936, we finished at Kabul our
preparations for the expedition which we were to send
towarda the archeeological sites of the region of Sar-o-Tar
in the Afghan part of ancient Seistan, some fragments of
statuettes, fragile clay-modellings, were brought to the
Museum of Kabul. These objects could not but immediate-
ly attract our attention, They undoubtedly formed a new
acquisition of very great interest: Collected by the Governor
of Siyahgird’ from the Ghorband, these fragments had been
discovered by the peasants of the village of Fondukistan’
who were roused to activity by the children that had climbed
the hill on the morrow of a heavy rainfall. A crevice cut
through by the sudden afflux of water had brought to light
some of these fragments belonging, as we recognised later,
to the decoration of niche A of the sanctuary. A recon-
naissance carried out on the 25th September (when Messrs.
Carl and Meunié accompanied me) enabled us to recognise
the importance of the site and the interest which a methodi-
cally-conducted excavation would create. The work begun
in May 1937 was conducted by M. J. Carl assisted by M.
Mohammed Aziz Khan, a former pupil of the Ecole des
Beaux-Arts of Kabul. 1 found occasion several times to
visit the sheds in order to follow the work of excavation
and to study the site along with the numerous objects
brought to light.

The Buddhist monastery of Fondukistan comprises a
sanctuary and its appendages: cells, meeting-halls and out-
houses. M. J. Carl first took up the clearance of the sanctuary
which was a hall on an evidently square plan, apparently
with cylindrical vault and built of unbaked bricks. of large
dimensions. The deep niches likewise vaulted with cyli
drical vault opened into a great hall of which the centre was

occupied by a stiipa of square base. Externally each of
these niches was framed in a simple arcade; these elements
were connected with the others by a horizontal string-course
resisting on pilasters with pseudo-Corinthian capitals which
were distributed on both sides of the entrance of each
niche. The modelled ‘scroll-patterns forming this cincture
of arcades resemble very closely (we shall have occasion to
return to this subject) the modelled decoration of the Caves
I, Il and XI of Bamiyan. The carefully executed paintings
covered the vault and the walls of the niche, the figures
being still visible in places. The paintings form only a
small part of the completed decorative programme; the most
marked element is represented by the clay-modellings, large
statues placed at the bottom of the niches, busts fixed
against the wall by means of wooden dowels; a clever poly-
chromy rendered all these elements clearly of a piece with
the painted decoration.

The openings of all these niches were totally blocked
and the rubbish in places formed a veritable mortar which
the pick-axe could not remove; let us add that the vaults of
niches A, F and G had given way. It was owing to this
fact, since the washing away of the rain-water had been very
effective, that the fragments forming a part of decoration
of niche A had been partly extricated. As we have seen,
these objects found their way to the Museum of Kabul where
they were exhibited in September 1936."

‘The observations made by M. J. Carl, while proceeding
to the clearance of niche A, show that these statues were
fixed against the wall by means of wooden dowels and that
only the upper portion of the body appeared to be placed
in the offset of a small balustrade support. Niche A com-
prised iconographic details of the same order, the balustrade
being replaced by a drapery (fig. 3). In both cases (niches

A and B) an anatomical peculiarity attracts the atten-
tion of the observer, namely, a lengthening and a very
marked curvature of the torso, this curvature in arch being
accentuated by the inclination of the head. Of the speci-
mens representing female personages, the measurements
taken show prominently a marked contrast between the waist
and the hips. In conclusion, it should be mentioned that
the feminine costume of Central Asia is also represented
(fg. 2). Although very much damaged, the fragment of
this statuette shows the characteristic details, viz., an
adjusted corset closely fitting the torso up to the base of
the breasts which are covered with a light stuf (fig. 2).
Among the fragments brought to light, No. 3-(fig. 3) clearly
bears the impress of Indian influence. It is only distin-
guished from an Indian image by the shorter length of the
arme. This specimen, by its elongated torso, its spare
waist, its very developed hips, shows itself distinctly Indian.
Equally Indian is the necklace of pearls passing between
the two breasts 0 as to go round the waist. One of the male
figures (fig. 4) wears, tied around the torso, a sort of scarf
resembling the udarabandha of purely Indian statues.” It
should be noted that the very large and widely opened eyes
have hemmed eye-lashes, the exophthalmia being now and
then accentuated. Occasionally also the eye-brows are
placed very high, such is the case with a Bodhisattva whose
hair exhibits by its short waves a Hellenistic treatment (fig. 5).
This is the only trace of Hellenistic influence which it has
been given to us to turn up while examining the objects
brought to light in A. The ornaments consist of necklaces,
medallions and curious bracelets (keyiiras) adorning the
upper portion of the arms. These ornaments are provided
with pendants and they very distinctly resemble certain
motife of omamentation of Gupta style.

Niche B

Niche B was blocked by rubbish and earth forming
compact blocks transformed by the action of rain-water
into a veritable mortar, upon which the pick-axe had no
effect. We had to renounce the clearance of this niche.

The statues which were fragile modellings confined
in a compact and very firm gangue could not be
extricated,

Niche C

As the rain-water did not penetrate very much into the
interior of this niche, the rubbish was not formed as was the
case with B, into compact blocks unassailable by the pick-
axe. The clearance of niche C, although a very slow pro-
cess, wae carried out in a satisfactory manner. The hori-
zontal portion of the decoration of the facade appeared at
firet; the double border of the scroll-pattern came out, on
the right, from a small vase placed at the bottom of the
east face of the wall (fig. 6). The small vase placed exactly
at the angle served to balance the borders of the scroll-
pattern of the northern and eastern faces. The upper border-

of the ‘arcade just forms a-double carved ‘bracket ‘(fig.- 1)
resembling what we found in the Caves I; Il: and: XI of
Bamiyan (fig. 8). This double bracket was apparently sur:
mounted by a small fluted and ribboned vase from which
escaped two sinuous waves; the whole’ resembling what we
have’ observed at Bamiyan (fig. 8);!° a fragment of the left
part of the ribbon is still visible. Between -the niches C
and D the string-course of the coupling-piece was’ adorned
in the middle with a human circular mascaron encircled by
leaves resembling those which entered into the composition
of the scroll-pattern (see niche E). The stalks of the scroll-
Pattern emerge from the mouth of the mascaron which has
not the bestial aspect of the mascarons, the coupling-piecés
of Caves I, Il and: XI of Bamiyan. -The upper portion of
the. string-course’ is adorned with’ birds flying ‘towards the
left. The base of the niche was occupied by a seated
Buddha (fig. 9), draped in a monastic mantle covering both
shoulders from which the flames gushed out; water, traversed
by very stylised waves treated in low relief, appeared at the
base, of the pedestal. We find ourselves therefore in pre-
sence of a representation of the Buddha of the Great
Miracle (Yamaka-pratiharya),- an iconographic theme fre-
quently found in ancient Kapiga: On each side of the great
Buddha whose head has not been found, two female figures
are seated with inclined heads, they have the waist supported
and the breast covered with a light corselet; a light scarf
covers the shoulders (fig. 10). Near the exit of the niche
there were two Buddhas seated in the pose’ of royal relaxa-
tion; the monastic mantle wound round s0 as to leave one
shoulder bare; the lower garment, cutting by its blue colour
across the red of the monastic’ mantle, was found fixed
against the torso. The monastic mantle with regular creased
folds adheres to the torso whose’ elegant model remains
very clear. The waist is spare, the chest developed, the

upper portion of the body gives an impression of elegance
and of grace full of dignity. This suppleness recalls the
very distinct Gupta and post-Gupta Indian reminiscences in
reaction against the heaviness of the last productions of the
artists of Gandhara and of Kapiéa (fig. 11).

On each side of the summit of the vault are distinctly
seen traces of the nimbus and the aureoles and the holes
for fixing the wooden dowels: these last marked the posi-
tions which had been occupied by the figures represented
in bust above a drapery equally fixed against the wall.
‘These models, which have unhappily been destroyed, were
of the same type as those found in niche E. The standing
figures had likewise occupied the positions marked by their
nimbus and their aureoles, slightly beyond the assistant
Buddhas represented as seated. On the right lateral wall
towards the entrance of the niche at mid-height between the
ground and the vault, there appeared still in place a model-
ling of a sleeping female; the head turned towards the en-
trance of the niche rests on a pile of three flat pillows, a quilt
covers the lower part of the body leaving bare the very re-
markable abdomen which is pierced by a hole at the posi-
tion of the navel, the arms rest along the body, the hair is
wavy, the eyes appear closed. Behind this figure and
fixed against the wall is a sort of triangular screen of stylised
flames. We find ourselves apparently in presence of a re-
presentation of the mother of Jyotigka, the child saved from
fire by the miraculous intervention of Buddha (fig. 12).

Of the three Gandharian bas-reliefs representing this
scene and reproduced by M. A. Foucher in his “Art gréco-
bouddhique du Gandhdra," the third alone could be compar-
ed with modellings of niche C; fragment shows the child
still half-entangled in the material bosom amidst the flames.
The child should be equally represented at Fondukistan,
and if it has disappeared, the position which it occupied is
still marked by the opening in the abdomen of the mother.

In fact, the miracle limite itself to a ceesarian operation
carried out ‘in difficult conditions. It should be noted that
both peisonages represented in bust are standing at the
height of the head of the sleeping female. The paintings
adorning the niche are very much damaged: the dominant
colour was a gouache blue; a reddish brown likewise ap-
pears as well as several touches of green.

NICHE D

The decoration on the facade of niche D has completely
disappeared. Against the wall from the base of the niche
there leaned up a large Bodhisattva seated in the posture
of royal relaxation (lalitasana) on a pedestal depicting a
fictitious arrangement of horizontally disposed bricks; under
a Bodhi tree (of ficus religiosa variety) the whole upper por-
tion of the body has disappeared (fig. 13), but the head of
the statue has been found among the rubbish which en-
cumbered the entrance of the niche (fig. 14). Of the diadem
nothing more survives than a very small circle adorned with
an egg-shaped decoration, from which the short meshes and
curls of hair escape at regular intervals. The face was
covered with gold-leaves laid on a red background. The
very prominent eye-bell is partly covered by the eyelids
in such a way that the palpebral slit appears very elongated,
the outer angle being characterised by a very pointed form.
The eye-brows, placed very high, present a regular traci
the nose very lightly ‘snubbed is large enough; the mouth
small, the lips fleshy; the general effect of the mascaron rela-
tively squat and chubby. Reverting to what is left of ‘the
statue of a very delicate model, we perceive the left leg,
of which the naked feet rest on a lotus, the dhoti delicately
envelopes the leg of which the elegant curve is visible under
the light stuff which is pleated in sinuous and subtly arrang-
ed folds; the right upraised leg is supported by three super-
imposed cushions—a branch of the ficus appears in the

space comprised between the calf and the haunch. The
statue had for its background an aureole fringed with small
oval ornaments emphasised by a pearl, each of these ele-
ments being surmounted by thiee pearls. Above the
aureole appear. the branches and leaves of the ficus,
several branches of which the traces are visible on the
wall have detatched themselves. Inclining against the right
corer at the junction of the walls (with reference to the
principal statue) of the niche, there appeared a secondary
seated divinity, the left leg placed under the hanging right
leg (fig. 15). This representation, by the subtleness of its
attitude, the grace and elegance of its form, the affection
of ite gesture, recalls the post-Gupta Indian antecedents,
The ornaments form a remarkable group finely wrought
by the goldsmith, of which the principal decorative motif
found in the diadem, the pendentive necklace and the rings
on the arms, is composed of a central cabochon
above and below which appear the ornaments of trefoil
shape; these motifs are fringed by scroll-pattern ornaments
of which the curved parts are slightly dented at their termi-
nal parts; this detail resembles a peculiarity which we shall
have occasion to point out while studying the scroll-patterns
surmounting the entrance of niche E. The necklaces and
bracelets are formed of large pearls. The diadem comprises
an ornamentation of complex character; the motif with
cabochon and scroll-pattern is twice repeated there. A’
large flower with elongated petals resembling a clematis
is laid on a double crown of flowers with five engraved
petals of rounded form. The second crown placed above
the first encircles a chignon elegantly disposed in the form
of a vertically raised shell. The lower crown rests upon a
rolled headband and slightly brings back 'the hair from
behind; the diadem appears fixed and supported by a large
ribbon which falls sinuously behind the head. The black
hair with’ long curls disposed symmetrically sprawls out on
the shoulder; two meshes diverge towards the chest. The
statue, when extricated, was in a state of remarkable fresh-

ness. The tint of extreme whiteness formed a thin pellicle
laid upon a reddish plaster. The very large eyes with
pronounced exophthalmy, with the pupils surrounded with
black, give the whole work a surprising appearance of life.
The highly raised and very divergent eye-brows are also
black; the nose large and slightly flattened. The colours
including the blue bands of the dhoti are placed layer by
layer 80 as to leave behind only the basic reddish
colour (fig. 16). Another devata of the same type
as that which we have’ just described, was placed
in the left wall-corner of the niche. Obviously of the
same height as the devatds there appeared fixed against the
lateral right and left walls of this same niche but partially
destroyed, a few Buddhas seated upon the lotus; on the
tight a Buddha of classical type whose torso having for its
background an aureole bordered with stylised flames was
found broken at the feet of the central Bodhisattva; on the
left an ornamental Buddha (fig. 17), the upper part of whose
body was intact, while the face was mutilated (the restora-
tion was affected at Paris). This Buddha partly concealing
the sarighafi wore a sort of hood with three points of blue
colour and adorned with square and round cabochons; these
last are encircled with pearls and provided with a
pendant resembling those which appeared to be attached
to the necklace and the border of the hood. It should be
noted that the hood with three points is not peculiar to
Fondukistan; a fragment of a statuette in stucco, discovered
at Hadda (mission J. Barthoux) exhibits a garment of the
same kind; in this last case the Buddha wears a necklace in
the form of a torque and a second necklace with three
tough plaits lengthened by the heads of makaras (?) confront-
ing each other and holding in their mouths the end of a small
chain with a cabochon. Three crescents adorn the hood,
‘one in a median position on the chest and the other two
‘on the shoulders. We have already had occasion to indi-
cate this type of garment while studying the iconography
of the paintings in the rupestral sanctuary of Bamiyan

(Cave I). We have here to deal with an ornamented Buddha
appearing at the summit of the vault of the sanctuary.”?
The two Buddhas to which we have just alluded, while
passing in review the objects brought to light in niche D,
were placed (as we have had occasion to remark) upon the
lotus. The stalks which support the lotus plunge into a small
basin from which two Naga kings rise into view (fig. 18).
The upper part of the body alone emerges; it would seem
that we are confronted with a representation of a purely
anthropomorphic character. Lightly bent, they lean on
their elbows against the upraised border of the basin. The
height and the base of the torso appear to prolong by their
quasi-reptilian subtleness the zoomorphic portion of these
human serpents which is concealed (fig. 19). The physical
type is singular; the elongated face with very convexed
front; it resembles, however, the physical aspect of the
devatds and the Buddhas we have already studied. The
hair arranged into a chignon is represented by short waves.
In the hair there appears a serpent with body marked by

phasises the lower part of the abdomen. A curious vest-
ment in the form of a breast-plate covers the chest and a
portion of the abdomen (fig. 20).

Notes on the Historical Geography of the
Malay Peninsula and Archipelago

By K. A. Nilakanta Sastri

Information relating to the ancient geography and history
of Malayasia comes to us from different sources:

(a) inscriptions, literature and traditions of the
locality;

(b) Indian literature and epigraphy;

(c)_ notices of classical writers, particularly in Ptolemy's
geography;
(a) Chinese travel books and animals ; and

(e) Arabic travellers and geographers.

Sometimes the data drawn from two or more of these
sources corroborate one another admirably, and in these
instances we can be sure of our conclusions from such data.
But more often they are conflicting, and this gives rise to
divergent views of their true import.

Recently Mr. Ir. J. L. Moens hag attempted to review
these data primarily from the geographical standpoint in a
comprehensive paper on (/rivijaya, Yava en Kataha in the
Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en volkenkunde for
1937 (pp. 317-486). I have already examined the subject in
80 far as it relates to Kataha,’ and I propose in what follows
to discuss as briefly as possible some of the other questions
arising out of Moens’ paper.

Moens’ introduction to his paper lays stress on the
difficulties and uncertainties of the subject and the wide scope
offered by these for differences of opinion. Authors trans-
cribing foreign proper names adopt one of several methods
open to them; they transcribe the names phonetically using

16 K. A. NILAKANTA SASTRI

the symbols in their own language which approximate closet
to the original names as they read it or heard it pronounced;
they take the substance of the name and translate it into
their own language; or finally they fasten their attention on
some prominent feature of the land they have in mind and
give it a new name indicating this feature. The Chinese
writers seem to have adopted all these methods, and we often
lack the means of deciding which one has been followed in
any given case. And they often reproduce earlier writers
without revealing their sources. The Arab writers, numerous
though they be, are. not as valuable or precise as they appear;
for here again later writers copied the earlier ones, and their
data on the latitudes and longitudes of places, like those
of Ptolemy, do not seem to bear any tangible relation to
facts, and are often no more helpful in deciding the identity
of places than their general descriptions of them. Again it
seems possible that data relating to different places with
similar names or to one and the same place but of differ-
ent epochs sometimes got mixed up in these accounts. And
the need for proceeding with caution is self-evident.

The standpoint from which I have sought to approach
the points made in Moens’ learned paper may be briefly
indicated at the outset. Much hard work has been done on
these questions and certain conclusions have gained more
or less general consent from scholars. While these conclu-
sions are by no means the last word on the subject and we
should be prepared to overthrow them and put others in their
place if proper reasons are shown, we should be prepared
to maintain them as against any others which are not demons-
trably superior to them in validity. I shall illustrate my mean-
ing by a reference to some general principles laid down by
Moens jn his introduction (Inleiding). He says for instance :
“And certainly it is in my opinion not proper to twist posi-
tive geographical indications to (support) an idea founded
exclusively on a phonetical identity of names. I recall here
the generally accepted identification of Ché-po (Ho-ling) of
the seventh to ninth century, which according to the Chinese

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 17

sources must have lain in the Northern Hemisphere, with
our Java (Ché-po) that lies on the other side of the equator.""*
But does this mean anything more than that Moens prefers
to attach more importance to some geographical data than
to identity of names? And in the very next paragraph he
proceeds to state another principle which reste at least in
part on the very phonetic identity of names, so heavily
discounted earlier. For he says: “If however by a sound
application of the available geographical (and historical)
checks we determine the approximate location of a given
place or district, and also find still in that very neighbourhood
‘an indigenous name which is a phonetic equivalent—or even
only an approximation—of the given transcription, then, I
think, we may, with good reason, suppose that we have been
on the right track."” Here again much must depend on the
‘sound application’ of the available data, historical and
geographical; Moens himself speaks elsewhere of insuper-
able difficulties that crop up in relating the old geographical
data to modern maps;* and there is further the possibility of
data relating to different places of the same name or with
similar names having been mixed up in our sources. In
fact, the very statements of the principles I have cited in
Moens’ own words, hedged in by so many if-s, go to show
that there can be no simple rules on this subject and that
the scope for differences of view is very wide indeed.

The next step in Moens’ argument relates to what he
considers to be the difficulties peculiar to Indonesia. He
says that the states with which we are concerned were
Pirate-states with very limited jurisdiction outside their
chief strongholds, and that till the 18th century when the
European powerg began to exercise some steadying influence,
these pirate-states, no sea-powers these, repeatedly changed
the locality of their strongholds without any change in the
names of the states. And he cites some late instances of
this phenomenon. There were pirates in all ages, and just

2 Op. dit. p, 323. 3 Op. cit. 324-5,

Google
18 K. A. NILAKANTA SASTRI

before the establishment of the European domination in the
East, piracy was more rampant than ever; but one may
doubt if this justifies the sweeping inference of Moens that
all Indonesian states were pirate-states throughout the ages.
This at any rate is not the impression | have derived from
the study of the inscriptions and literature bearing on the
Hindu period of Indonesia with which we are primarily con-
cerned, and | am therefore inclined to view with suspicion
any reasoning based on this large, unproven, and improbable
assumption,

Moens concludes the introduction by avowing his greater
faith in the geographical data from the ancient geographers
and travellers and maps of more recent times than a philo-
logist like Ferrand was inclined to evince, and by stating
that if his new attempt to interpret these data is at all just,
the entire structure of early Malayasian history will have to
be rebuilt from the beginning.

I

The location of Srivijaya is the first problem Moens takes
up for consideration. He points out that the Chinese and
often also the Arab writers think of Malaka as extending
East to West, instead of N.W. to S.E., and Sumatra as lying
parallel to and south of Malaka, and finally of Java as lying
to the east of it, so that the Chinese held it to be S.E. of
Canton, and not S.S.W. as on a modern map. This wrong
alignment must be corrected before any attempt is made to
identify places on modern maps. Again in the days of
sailing ships, the duration of a voyage from one place to
another varied with many factors, the nature of the wind
and the type of ship being most important among them;
hence the distances mentioned in our sources can be accept~
ed only as rough indications.

Ltsing (Record, completed 692 A.D.) and the T’ang
Annals agree in locating Srivijaya to the East, i.e., S.E., in
modern maps, of P’o-lou-che (Baros), and this leads Moens

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 19

to conclude that the place must have been on or near the
east coast of central Sumatra, ‘near the equator and on the
maritime route between China and India.‘ But a place
farther to the south on the east coast of Sumatra is certainly
not ruled out by the vague indications of these two Chinese
authorities.

In the itinerary of his journey to India I-tsing gives the
following data:

Ton-kin to, Srivijaya 30 days
Srivijaya to Malaya 15 days
Malayu to Kédah (Kie-tch’a) 15 days
Kédah to Negapatam 30 days

But he says in his Record: ‘Malayu is now Srivijaya.’
Moens concludes from this that at the time of I-tsing’s
journey from Canton to India in 671 A.D. Mi was
midway between Srivijaya and Kédah. And as I-tsing says
also that he changed direction at Malayu for going to Kie-
tch’a (Kédah), the chances are that Srivijaya must be sought
on the east coast of the Malaka about the same latitude as
Kédah and that Malayu must have been somewhere on the
east coast of Sumatra, possibly at Palembang on the estuary
of the Musi. And this location of Malayu in this period gains
support from Krom’s discovery of the name of Malayu at
the end of line 7 of the Kedukan Bukit inscription.’
Palembang was called Malayo by the Javanese in the days of
Albuquerque.*

The statement in the Record: ‘Malayu is now
Srivijaya’ may thus be understood literally, and we suppose

4 Moens says that Kazwini (13th century) locates Srivijaya in the
same locality and refers to Pelliot p. 339. Now the passage cited
by Pelliot locating Sribuza at the extremity of the island of Lameri
is from the Adjaib of Buzurg ibn Shahriyar, and I do not think that
the passage lends any clear support to Moens’ view as he himself
allows in the course of his discussion (pp. 331-2).

that as a result of the expedition recorded in the Kedukan
Bukit inscription the king of Srivijaya established himself in
Malayu, in other words, that Palembang became Srivijaya
from that date (683 A.D.), The change of the location of
Srivijaya was then the most important part of the Srivijaya-
Jaya-Siddhayatra recorded in the K. B. inscription dated
683 A.D. And Ccedés has recently restated convincingly the
case for locating the historic Srivijaya at Palembang.’

Moens finds confirmation of the original location of
Srivijaya on the east coast of Malaka in the statement of
the New T’ang Annals that at Srivijaya a gnomon of 8’ cast
a shadow towards the south of the length of 2’ 5” on the
day of the summer-solstice. And unless we assume a
change of locality in the meantime, this datum could not
be easily reconciled with the statement of I-tsing that during
the two eguinoxes almost no shadow was cast at midday in
Srivijaya either by a gnomon or by a man standing erect,
and that the maximum shadows, northward as well as south-
ward, cast in the course of a year are there practically equal.
But neither this statement of I-tsing nor even that of Yakit
(cited by, Moens) that Sribuza is an island on the equator
exporting camphor is, I think, sufficiently precise to enable
us to decide between the usual location of Srivijaya in the
neighbourhood of Palembang and the Kampar basin
proposed for it by Moens.*

Moens, however, says: ‘Srivijaya could first establish
itself in Malayu after it had mastered its capital Palembang
and driven out the ruling family;* and adds: ‘it established
ite capital, however, elsewhere in this land Malayu, viz., more
to the north, in the direct neighbourhood of the Strait which

8 Op. cit. pp. 334-37. See also Takakusu, Record, pp. 143-44, and
n. 3. Moens himself admits the approximate nature of these
astronomical data in discussing the site of old Kelatan, Ibid, p. 342.

9 Tbid., p. 333.

Google

GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 21

it was to command thereafter.’ Moens seeke support for
this more northerly position of Srivijaya from other sources
besides the astronomical data from I-tsing. Kia Tan's
statement that Lo-yue and Srivijaya lie on the opposite coasts
of the Malaka Strait implies that the latter must be nearer
the maritime route rounding Malay Peninsula than
Palembang.” The present morassy condition of the Kampar
delta suggests that about twelve centuries ago the coast must
have lain much farther to the west than now, and the Arab
descriptions (Buzurg, Ibn Said, Abulfeda) of the estuary on
which Serbuza is located tally with this. The capital situat-
ed on the Kampar must have occupied an easily defended
position behind the labyrinth of water routes cut up by
numerous little islands that could accommodate a large fleet
unnoticed by the enemy. And the fertile country of the
Padang highlands behind it must have put it into easy touch
with the ancient port of Priaman on the opposite coast of
Sumatra facing the Indian Ocean. The excellence of the
site was shown in modern times by the lively trade between
Kampar and Singapore which flourished till the rise of a
new harbour, Emurahaven about 1892. All these factors
render it probable in Moens’ opinion that the ruins of
Muara Takus +0-20° NLL. are the remains of Srivijaya after
ite transplantation to Sumatra, There are local traditions
here of an extensive city (the round of which a cat took
three months to cover) under Raja (Sri) vijaya, and of a Datu
Srivijaya living in Kota Baru or near about. Alll this renders
it highly probable that the capital city of Srivijaya is repre-
sented by the ruins of Muara Takus near the confluence of
Kampar Kanan and Batang Mahat in the heart of Central
Sumatra.

I believe I have fairly summarised all the considerations
urged by Moens in favour of his suggestion regarding the
new location of Srivijaya. I do not think, however, that
any of them or all of them taken together are of sufficient

Google
22 K. A. NILAKANTA SASTRI

weight to prevail against those which point to Palembang
and its neighbourhood as the site of Srivijaya. The early
Buddha statue from Bukit Seguntang and the Kedukan
Bukit record seem to leave no room for any further doubt
in this matter. All the other considerations, including the
citations from Arab writers, are indecisive and seem to apply
as much to Palembang, if not better, as to the other site.
The ruine of Muara Takus may indeed in part go back to
the age of Srivijaya, and this is quite intelligible in the light
of the epigraphical evidence pointing to the erection of
similar structures in parts of the, Malaka peninsula under the
hegemony of Srivijaya."! In fact, the tradition relating to
Datu Srivijaya indicates, as Krom has observed, not that the
capital city lay here, but only a provincial headquarter ruled
by a datu of Srivijaya and that the place stood in the same
relation to Srivijaya as Bangka and Karang Brahi under the
jurisdiction of similar datus."? I do not think that a case has
been made out for the view that the transplantation of
Srivijaya comprised two stages: (1) the overpowering of
Palembang, the old capital of Malayu and (2) the establish-
ment of the centre of the new power further north at Muara
Takus.

Moens says elsewhere :'* ‘As a result of the usual
identification of the capital Srivijaya with Palembang, people
were obliged to locate Malayu elsewhere and it was easy to
choose the neighbouring place of Jambi for that purpose.
We must correct this generally accepted opinion to this
extent, viz., that the oldest Malayu comprised Palembang as
well as Jambi, in other words, included the whole of Middle
and South Sumatra.’ The conclusion reached here seems
probable now not, however, for the reason assigned by
Moens, but because of the new reading proposed by Krom

for part of I. 7 of Kedukan Bukit inscription to which
reference was made above.

The upshot of this discussion may be summed up briefly
thus. Srivijaya does seem to have changed its situation in
the interval between I-tsing’s first visit (671) and the period
of his literary activity there (685-92); the evidence in favour
of this view is furnished by:

1. the statement of I-tsing that Malayu had become
Srivijaya;
2. the connection between the conquest of Malayu and
the Srivijaya-jaya-siddhayatra established by
Krom’'s reading of 1. 7 of the Kedukan Bukit
record; and
3. the astronomical data on Srivijaya supplied by the
New T'ang Annals and by I-tsing to the com-
bined significance of which Moens has drawn
pointed attention.
But the site of Palembang, either itself called Malayu at
first or situated in a district with that name, became
Srivijaya after the transfer, and became the seat of the
famous empire passing under that name in history, and the
arguments adduced in support of a more northern site in
Central Sumatra do not seem to bear the test of criticism.
It seems probable that the original site of Srivijaya lay some-
where on the east coast of Malaka. For establishing this
Proposition I-tsing’s itineraries seem to be enough. But
Moens has adduced other arguments which are closely bound
up with the location and history of Ché-po (Yava) and must
be considered along with that subject.

bt

The discussion of the location of Yava is opened by
Moens with the statement: “In order not to get entangled
in the many names of lands which are homophonous with our
name Java, we must weigh with care the geographical con-
tent of the relative sources as well as their chronological

Google
24 K. A. NILAKANTA SASTRI

order.” This is again one of tk 2 general principles which
appear quite sound because in the abstract they state only
the obvious, but which when applied to individual cases,
begin to exhibit wide differences in the hands of different
writers.

“Before all’, continues Moens, “‘we should learn to free
ourselves from current notions which, considered critically,
mostly continue the tradition of more or lese intuitive identi-
fications of places. Thus, for instance, it should seem that
names like Yavadvipa of the Ramayana and of the inscrip-
tion of Safijaya of 732 A.D., the second century Jabadiou of
Ptolemy, the third century Tchou-po, the fifth century
Ye-p’o-ti and Cho-p’o, the sixth century Tou-po, the seventh
century Yen-mo-na of Hiuen-Teang, the Ho-ling of J-tsing,
that in the T’ang annals (618-906 A.D.) is also called Cho-p’o,
and lastly the ninth century and later Arabic Zabag or
Zabaj, signify not our Java, as has been supposed till now,
nor even one and the same (is) land. Java is indeed desig-
nated Ché-p’o from the beginning of the tenth century first
in the Song annals (906-1279 A.D.) as will appear from the
geographical position described in the chronicle in detail.
And it is this last Ché-p’o—not the fifth century one, as
Pellict thought,—that gets in the thirteenth century the
Chinese name which stands phonetically closer to our name
Java, viz., Chao-wa, also written Koua-wa by mistak «
We see here the general trend of Moens’ method and
conclusions; we must follow his detailed demonstrations to
find out how far he has succeeded in his endeavour to re-
place the ‘intuitive’ traditional identifications of places now
generally accepted.

And first as regards Ché-p’o before the beginning of the
Song period (tenth century A.D.). The crucial passage here
is the statement in the Annals of the First Song Dynasty
(420-478 A.D.): ‘the kingdom of Ho-lo-tan on the island of
Ché-p’o sent an embassy to present the products of the

14 Op. cit. p. 348.

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 25

country’. Again, the Souei annals (589-618 A.D.) state that
the kingdom of Ho-lotan lies to the south of Tch’e-tou.'*
The method followed by all writers who have dealt with
these texts is to fix the location of one of the places men-
tioned in them and then suggest identifications of the other
places with reference to that one. Pelliot starts by assum-
ing that Ché-p’o is Java; before him Schlegel, and now
Moens, by supposing that Ho-lo-tan is Kelantan. Thus
Pelliot observes:'* “If Ché-p’o is Java, it follows from the
text of the Song-chou that Ho-lo-tan was in Java; and
and this contradicts Schlegel who identifies it with Kelantan.”
Moene, on the other hand, says:"” “‘If my identification of the
kingdom Ho-lo-tan of the 5th century situated on the island
Ché-p'o with the present-day Kelatan on the east coast of
Malaka, is correct, then must this “‘island Ché-p’o indeed
stand for Malaka!"’ But when Moens proposes this identi-

tentative, and not material to

Again Tch’e-tou (red earth) is identified by Schlegel with
Siam and as a result Ho-lo-tan to the south of it is sought
by him in the Malay peninsula, Pelliot doubte the identity
of Siam with Tch’e-tou, but also adds'* that even if this is
granted for the sake of argument, Ho-lo-tan in Java may
still be described as lying to the south of Tch’e-tou, like
saying: Algeria js to the south of France. Moens holds**
that Tch’e-tou is the same as the Raktamrttika of a fifth cen-
tury inscription from province Wellesley and locates it in
ancient Patalung near modern Sengora where the red colour
of the soil and red sandstone hillocks have been noticed by
modern travellers, The location of the Raktamrttika of the
inscription is not beyond dispute, and it has been held’ on
good ground that this place must have been in India. We see

then how uncertain the whole matter is; Ché-p'o=Malaka
(Moens) has no more in its favour than Ché-p'o=Java
(Pelliot).

Now Moens sets forth some new arguments in favour of
his position. First, he seeks to demonstrate that Ché-p’o
and Kie-tch’a represent one and the same town.” He points
out that Ho-ling is also called Ché-p’o in the New T'ang
Annals, which state at the same time that the kings of
Ho-ling lived in the city of Ché-p’o. After observing that
the name of the country and its capital seem to have changed
places and that chroniclers were still under the influence of
traditional name Yava=Ché-p’o—statements which seem to
have no direct bearing on the argument,—Moens asserts:
“'I|-tsing, who personally visited the capital and the country,
speaks no more of Ché-p’o in the seventh century, and just
calls the land Ho-ling; he designates the capital by its native
name Kie-tch'a. As place-names Ché-p’o and Kie-tch’a
Tepresent one and the same town.” He gives no specific
references to I-tsing to support these statements. But L-tsing
speaks more often of the country of Kie-tch'a—pays de Kié-
tch’a,” royaume de Kié-tch’a,* and clearly distinguishes it
from the land of Ho-ling in one context where he writes :**
"He left the land of the Three Rivers (China). He set sail at
hie ease from Chang-King; he was tossed about on the waves
to the north of Ho-ling. He travelled over all the islands
successively and reached by degrees the isle of Kie-tch’a’.
Kie-tch'a and Ché-po (Ho-ling) cannot therefore be accepted
as alternative names of one and the same city. It is perhaps
worth noting, however, that Moens grants that I-tsing’s
Ho-ling is the same as the Ché-p'o of the older accounts,
and if this be so, the passage I have cited from I-tsing goes
some way towards suggesting the equation of Ché-p‘o=
Ho-ling= Java.

The boundaries of Ho-ling described in the Old and New
T'ang Annals are then examined by Moens for support for
his position (Ho-ling) Ché-p'o=Malaka. These boundaries
are: P'o-li in the east, T’o-p'o-teng on the west, the sea on
the south, and Tcherla on the north. Moens* applies a cor-
rection of 45° to the orientation of these boundaries and under-
stands West for instance to mean north-west. For him there-
fore the sea on the south of Holing is the Strait of Malaka.
All this would be so, if Ho-ling were established to be Malaka
on other grounds, As it is, | am not sure if Moens is not
begging the question. And the arguments he adduces afresh
in his elucidation of these boundaries are just those very
phonetic resemblances, the pursuit of which Moens con-
demns in his predecessors. There is one difference however;
the earlier writers studied resemblances between names given
by the Chinese authors and known modern names; Moens
improves upon them by postulating earlier forms of native
names from which the Chinese transcriptions might have been
derived. It is thus that he reconstructs the form ‘Dua
wwatan’, ‘two bridges-land’, to represent the obscure
T’o-p'o-teng; but of the fact that such a name was ever
used, he has no evidence to adduce. He has to rest con-
tent with pointing to the several routes along which small
craft are transported overland across the narrowest part of
the Isthums of Kra, and the advantages to trade from such
transhipment. One point more. The western, i.e., north-
western, neighbour of this land is called Mi-li-tché, which,
says Moens, ‘seems to be clearly a transcription of the even
now important port-city of Mergui, well known for its fine
pearls from early times’. I am not a sinologist, and I can
express no opinion on this; but I confess that from Mergui
to Mi-li-tcho, or vice-versa, seems to be a rather large leap.
Lastly, I-tsing locates Ho-ling to the south of Pan-pan at the
Bay of Bandon, and this points to Malaka being Ho-ling.
The passage of I-tsing”” referred to here reads: ‘‘He (Tan-

juen) embarked and travelled to the south with the hope of
reaching western India. But when he reached the country of
Pou-p’en, to the north of Ho-ling, he fell ill and died.” 1
am willing to assume with Moens that the place-name trans-
cribed as Pou-p’en by Chavannes is the same as Pan-pan;
but how does it fallow from this that Holing is not Java but
Malaka? Moens, it must be noted, admits that Cambodge
(Tchen-la) is to the north of his Ho-lin (Malaka), the inter-
vening sea notwithstanding. Even if Holing were Java,
Pan-pan would still lie to the north of it, as much as Tchen-la.

Kia Tan, a Chinese geographer of the late eighth
century, says that Ho-ling lies to the east of Foche
(Srivijaya) at a distance of four or five days’ journey, and
this cute againet Ho-ling being placed in Malaka. But
Moene is 90 convinced of the correctness of his view that he
Proposes to correct the word ‘east’ into ‘west’ in Kia Tan's
text, on the ground that Kia Tan journeying towards Ceylon
must have travelled west and reached Ho-ling en route.
Now, a perusal of Kia Tan's text would show that he was not
describing an actual journey at all, but only giving sailing
directions, as it were. Here are his words:** From north
to south it (the Straits of Malaka) is a hundred li. On ite
north coast is the kingdom of Lo-yue; on the southern coast,
the kingdom of Fo-che. To the east of the kingdom of
Fo-che, going by water for four or five days, we reach the
kingdom of Ho-ling; it is the largest of the ieles of the south.
Then, towards the west, coming out of the straits, after three
or four days we reach the kingdom of Ko-ko-seng-tche, situ-
ated on an isle separated from Fo-che at the north-west
angle.’ This passage of Kia Tan upsets the pet notions of
Moens: it discredits directly the alteration in the text propos-
ed by Moen; it shows that the correct directions of the rela-
tive positions of places were known to Kia Tan, and casts
a doubt on Moens’ correction of directions in Chinese ac-

counts; finally it overthrows completely the proposed identi-

28 BEFEO, iv, p. 373-

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 29

fication of Ché-p’o (Ho-ling) with Malaka. Again I-tsing
mentions Ho-ling as a halt from which pilgrims to India
started for Malayu on their journey to India from China; and
Moens argues from this that Ho-ling was either a place on
the east coast of Malaka or Malaka itself.”* But this need not
be so at all, and [-tsing’s statement is quite intelligible if
Ho-ling were Java. And as Krom has pointed out pilgrims
touched at either Ho-ling or Fo-che, i.e., Java or Srivijaya,
before going to Malayu, and there is no instance of both
Ho-ling and Srivijaya being taken on the way,"* which again
is ‘quite intelligible in the face of Kia Tan's statement dis-
cussed above, that Ho-ling was at a distance of four or five
days’ journey to the east of Fo-che.

Iv

Turning them to a discussion of the location of P’o-li said
to lie to the east of Ho-ling, Moens makes a strenuous effort
to find support here for his identification of Ho-ling with
Malaka. P’o-li was also called Ma-li according to the T’ang
annals, and Schlegel thought this was really Ma-li-yeou, i.e.,
Malayu, But as Moens rightly points out I-tsing mentions
Malayu and P’oj as separate states. Moens’ own opinion
is that the data regarding P’o-li as we have them are the
result of a confusion on the part of Chinese authors between
two different places of the same name, and yet another place,
and he seeks to unravel the confusion in his own way; but
it is needless for us to follow the details of this part of his
discussion; for there is nothing in it to prevail against the
clear argument based on the ‘perfect phonetic concordance”
(Pelliot)*! between P’o-li and Bali, and the statements that
Ho-ling is to the east of Fo-che (Kia Tan) and that P’o-li is
to the east of Ho-ling. Moreover, Moens’ conclusion that

"o-li must be sought to the south-east of Malaka—which is

how he interprets east of Ho-ling—and thus either in
S. Sumatra or still further east in Java does not rest on any
tangible reasons. The Buddhist remains at Palembang or
the Sailendra relics of Java cited by Moens in support of
his position do not bear on this discussion; for according to
Moens’ there was a Buddhist P’o-li in the sixth century, but
not in the seventh.’*

Other arguments urged by Moens are equally incon-
clusive. Take the statements in the Leang annals on P’o-li;
“The kingdom of P'oli is situated to the south-east of
Canton, on an island in the sea; the distance from Canton is
two months, travelling daily. From east to west the
country is fifty days broad, and from north to south it is
twenty days; there are one hundred and thirty-six villages
in it. Moens remarks that according to the orientation of
old Chinese maps, S. Sumatra would be south-east of
Canton, and adds: ‘‘Ma-li appears further to be about
twice as long as broad which well es with the form of
south and middle Sumatra togethe: The real truth is
that the data regarding P’o-li or Ma-li are such that no identi-
fication can be proposed to satisfy them all; and it is no
wonder that, as Moens has pointed out himself, scholars
have ranged over all the lands from Borneo to Malabar in
vain to discover this elusive country. Again he argues that
in Souei times, the Chinese had no idea of the general for-
mation of Java, and that even in the T’ang period they might
have believed it to be part of a great continent stretching
right up to Africa. And as P’o-li which had an extent of
many thousand li-s from north to south sent an embassy to
China in 630 A.D., the period of the Tuk Mas inscription
from middle Java, therefore, this seventh century non-
Buddhist P’o-li must have lain in Middle Java. Ma-li, the
Buddhist P’o-li (sixth century) being South Sumatra and P'o-li
Middle Java, neither of the P’o-lis could be Bali.** ~The many

fallacies lurking behind each stage of such an argumentation
will not escape the reader.

The capital of Middle-Javanese P’o-li is sought by Moens
in the modern district centre of Pati near the northern coast
of Middle Java, but one looks in vain for any tangible reason
for this view.’ If there was a Middle Javanese P’oli and
Pati was its capital in the seventh century, then the plausible
geographical considerations by which Moens seeks to show
that it might have been once a good harbour will have some
value as strengthening an intrinsically probable position;*
but neither the height of Gunung Muria nor the silting up of
the Lusi river mouth can by themselves establish the locale
of the kingdom or its capital. And his account of the histori-
cal origin of Middle Javanese P’o-li only shows how strongly
he has prejudged the question on its geographical side. He
accepts the doubtful suggestion that Ma-li is Malayu, and
argues that the dynasty of Malayu went over to Middle Java
when it was driven out about 683 A.D. by the successful
naval expedition of Srivijaya. Perhaps there is nothing im-
possible in this suggestion though so far it lacks anything of
the nature of positive evidence. But then Moens seems to
forget the non-Buddhist character of Middle-Javanese P'o-li
of the seventh century on which he laid some stress earlier
in his paper,’ and now treats it as a Buddhist kingdom of
the Sailendras. And tempt to connect Kaundinya of
the sixth century P’o-li (Leang annals) with Kandara of the
Andhra country" is totally misplaced. Kaundinya is a gotra-
name and the Kandaras who belonged to the Ananda gotra
could not have had anything to do with them. Again,
Moens puts forward a vague suggestion of some connection
between the Kandaras and Kadambas, probably because
Jayaswal’s evidence relating to the Kaundinyas of South India
places them only in Kadamba country, and the Kandaras

were ruling in Andhra territory. Moens says “Of the
Kandara dynasty alas! little is known besides that they
ruled in about the same territory as the Ikevakus of the
second and third century. These last had their capital in
Nagarjunikonda, the original Sriparvata or Sriéaila on the
southern bank of the Kygna, not far from the later mountain
bearing a like name and connected with the Kadambas.””
It comes to this. Because the Kandaras ruled the land of
the Ikgvakus who had their capital at Sriparvata, and
Sriparvata is the name of another mountain of the Kadambas,
and because the Kaundinyas are known to have been in
Kadamba country, therefore Kandaras were Kaundinyas!
An argument in itself 20 weak as this gains no strength from
the references made by Moens to the attack of Vignukundins
on the Kandaras about 500 A.D. as furnishing the mative for
the migration of the Kandaras (Kaundinyas) to the
Archipelago, or to the great stone Buddha of Bukit Seguntang
as further proof of this proposition.” To seek to connect
Borobudur with Srigaila and thus point to this mountein as
the home of the Sailendras is even less plausible. The con-
nection between the Andhra country and the Archipelago
has never been in dispute; but we are not convinced that
Moens’ researches have brought any valid lackdation of
the time and circumstance of this connection.“

39. pp. 436-7.

4o In my paper on Kataba (JGIS., July 1938) I have discussed at
some length the considerations brought forward by Moens in favour
of an Andhra-Kalinga origin of the Sailendras. I may here add that
Moens does not seem to have quite decided between an Andhra and
a Kalifiga home for the Sailendras, and secondly between treating
the Middle Javan P’o-li as non-Buddhist kingdom and treating as
the Buddhist Sailendra kingdom displaced from Sumatra and migrat-
ing to Java as a result of Srivijaya’s conquest of Malayu in 683 A.D.
OF the presence of Sailendras anywhere before 778 A.D. (Kalasan
inscription) we have in fact as yet no evidence whatever.

Another kingdom mentioned in the Chinese annals is
Kin-li-pi-che to the south-west of Canton.‘! Pelliot is in-
clined to see in this name only a faulty form of Che-li-fo-che,
Moens, on the other hand, corrects the direction from S.W.
to S.E, and locates the kingdom in the N.E. part of Borneo.”
Again we have Tchou-po mentioned in the third century
which is most probably the same as Tou-po of the Souei
annals. This kingdom is placed in the China sea to the
east of Fu-nan at a distance several tens of days’ sailing.
There were seyeral kings on the island with capitals of
their own. With many reservations, but in almost entire
disregard of the distinct geographical indications, Pelliot
proposed to identify this land with Ché-p'o (Java). Accept-
ing a suggestion of Pelliot that the name Tchou-po had a
guttural ending in its ancient pronunciation, Moens identi-
fies it with Tabouk, the old name. of Kota Batu, the largest
city in Mindanac,* which satisfies the geographical require-
ments very well indeed. These two identifications are valu-
able as definitely extending the area of Hindu colonisation,
and one hopes that these conclusions of Moens will be fur-
ther strengthened by the progress of research. But it will
be seen that these questions have no bearing on the location
of Ché-p’o itself. Yet other identifications incidentally pro-
posed by Moens, but having no direct bearing on the question
of Ché-p’o are the following :

Lo-t'cha—either Moluccas or better, the island group
between Celebes and New Guinea, Mindanao
and probably north Celebes included.“*

Kin-fo, same as Kin-li-fo-che (cf. Na-sien from Nagasena),
and therefore, as noted already on the N.W.
coast of Borneo.‘*

Kingdom of Women (Strirajya) is Celebes.*

K’ouen-louen means the islands to the east of the Celebes,
the eastern part of the Archipelago; the land
where, as I-tsing notes, the Clepsydra was in
use as also the Sanskrit siitras and the rules
of grammar in the seventh century A.D.‘”

VI

Next Moens sets out to establish the identity of the
capital of Ho-ling (Ché-p’ ‘0) itself called Ché-p'o in the T'ang
annals, with modern Kedah or some place in its neighbour-
hood. His first, and perhaps the strongest argument, in
favour of this identification is the statement in the T'ang
annals relating to the town of Ché-p'o, viz.: ‘“When at the
summer-solstice a gnomon is erected of eight feet high,
the shadow (at noon) falls on the south side and is two feet
four inches long."“* This implies certainly a loca-
lity somewhere between 6° and 6° 30’ N.L., which must lie
on the eastern or western coast of Malaka. ‘If in I-tsing’s
time Kié-tch’a (Kédah) was the capital and might thus be
equated to Ché-p’o, the astronomical datum relating to which
has been given above, then the geographical location at 6°
to 6° 30’ N.L. should fit in very well and it would also be
established that Ché-p'o lay on the west coast of Malaka."*
But note the ‘if’ on which the argument rests; there is no
evidence to show that Kié-tch’a was the capital of Ho-ling
in I-teing’s time. Nay more, the references of I-tsing to these
two places indicate clearly that they had no connection with
each other and were places lying rather far apart. What he
says of the pilgrim Fa-tchen is pethaps worth citing again in
Chavannes’ words: ‘il sortit du pays des Trois flueves—Il
hissa la voile au large de Chang-king;—il fut ballotté sur les
flots au nord de Ho-ling—Il parcourut successivement toutes
les iles et arriva petit & petit ‘a celle de Kié-tch’a.’** No
wonder Pelliot felt that the astronomical datum of the T'ang

annals regarding the capital of Ho-ling was difficult to re-
concile with the other data we possess regarding it, and sug-
gested that we must assume some mistake to have crept into
the astronomical datum.**

The other arguments adduced by Moens in favour of
Kédah being identified with Ché-p’o are much less decisive.
He takes up, the account of a journey from Mi+'chen to
Ché-p’o translated by Pelliot from Sin t'ang chou, and seeks
to find support in this account for his position, Though
Moens does not accept Pelliot's identifications of Mi-tch’en
with Irawadi delta or of Ché-p’o with Java, he agrees with
him that the general direction of the journey was towards
the south.* This passage is of sufficient interest for us to
reproduce it here before reviewing its discussion by Moens.
I translate from Pelliot.

“From Mi-tch’en we reach K’ouen-lang, and here is
the tribe of the Little Kouen-louen; the king is called
Mang-si-yue; the customs are the same as at Mi-tch’en.
From K’ouen-lang, one goes to Lou-yu, where lies the
kingdom of the king of the Great K’ouenlouen. The
king is called Seew-li-po-p’o-nan-to-chau-na (Sribhavi
nandeéana2), The plain is more extensive than that at
Mi-tch’en. Travelling for half a day from the place
where the little king of the K’ouen-louen lives (sic), we
reach the bounds of Mo-ti-p’o (Martaban2). Going by
sea for five months (‘months’ is doubtless an error for
“days’), we reach the kingdom of Fo-tai, and here is
the branch of a stream which flows for 360 li, The king
is called Seewli-p'i-li-jouei. The country produces many
rare perfumes. To the north, there is an emporium
which is the rendezvous of merchantmen from divers
kingdoms. If we cross the sea, we reach Ché-p'o (Java).
Travelling for fifteen days, you pase two large mountains
one of them called Tcheng-mi and the other Ché-t'i.

There is a kingdom the king of which is called Sseu-li-
moho-lo-ché (Sri Maharaja). The customs are the same
as at Fo-tai. Cross the valley of To-jong-powlo
(Taujong-pura?) and you reach Ché-p’o (Java); then,
after a journey of eight days, you reach the kingdom of
P’o-houei-kia-lou. The country is warm; at the cross
roads and on the roads they have planted cocoanut and
areca palms; if you raise your head, you would not see
the sun. At the residence of the king, the tiles are of
gold, the kitchens being covered with tiles of silver.
Fragrant wood is burnt here. The halls are decorated
with shining pearls. There are two tanks with golden
banks; the cars of boats are covered gold and gems.""*
The emendations that Moens proposes to this itinerary
seem to me to be based on a preconceived scheme of identi-
fications, particularly on his own views regarding Ché-p’o.
The very first observation he makes on this text is enough
to show this. He says that the name Ché-po where it first
occurs in the above extract is clearly a mietake (Klaarblijkelijk
een verschriving), for both the kingdom of Ché-p’o and its
capital Ché-p’o are reached later on in the same narrative
after a further journey of two weeks southwards. He sug-
gests that it is most probable that a return to the continental
coast, the point from which the sea-voyage to Fo-tai began,
viz., Mo-ti-po, is meant; the journey to Fo-tai and the empo-
rium in the north of Sumatra being no more than an excursion
which took the traveller out of the main line of his route.“
But read the passage again, and it becomes clear that the
first mention of Ché-po is no more than a preliminary indica-
tion of the end of the voyage from Fo-tai, the details of
which follow in the next succeeding sentences. There
‘seems to be no warrant whatsoever for supposing a return to
Mo-ti-po, a postulate which in turn leads Moens to suggest
further : (I) that Mo-ti-po was not Martaban as Pelliot holds,
but some place in the neighbourhood of Ta-kua-pa,—for it

53 BEFEO, iv, pp. 223-4. 54. pp. 378 and 382.

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGO 37

sounds manifestly absurd to suggest that a person went back
from N. Sumatra (Fo-tai) to Martaban on his way to Malaka
(or Java); and (2) that the half-day’s sailing from Lou-yu to
Mo-ti-po is really a mistake for half-a-month’s sailing—a
suggestion for which support is found in Pelliot's emendation
of month into day in another context in the same extract.**

Next, accepting Pelliot’s identification of P’o-houei-Kia-
sseu with P’o-lou-Kia-sseu ta which the kings of Ho-ling
migrated from a more western capital, Moens makes two
suggestions : (|) that the movement from west to east must
really be from north to south, a correction necessitated
according to him by the Chinese orientation of Malaka and
(2) Baruas on Malaka’s west coast furnishes an acceptable
Phonetic parallel to P’o-lou-kia-ssev, adding that Baruas
must have sounded like the famous Bharukaccha and have
been transcribed similarly. Both these suggestions appear
to me to be of doubtful validity, and the appeal to local
tradition and the silting of the mouths of the mighty Perak
river to explain the ancient importance as a harbour of what
is now an inland village does not bring much strength to an
intrinsically weak case.°*

Moens continues his argument in these words: ‘From
the foregoing it is clear, seeing that both Takuapa or Mo-ti-
p’o and Baruas are places on the west coast, the whole
journey via., Ché-p'o is made along the coast,!? in other
words, that the capital Ché-p’o must have lain on Malaka’s
west coast, and this gives the answer also to the question
stated earlier of the situation of (the kingdom of) Ché-p’o.””
I confess my inability to follow this statement. The first
Part of it proves nothing; a journey from Burma to Ché-p’o,
whether Ché-p’o be Java or Malaka, must be made along

55 pp. 3778 56 pp. 382-4.

57 In a note Moens explains that a crossing from Takuapa first
to the east coast and voyage from there back to Baruas on the west
coast would have involved a much longer joumey (than one of 8
days)t

Google
38 K. A. NILAKANTA SASTRI

the west coast of Malaka; you could say that the whole
journey must have been along that coast only by assuming
that Ché-p’o is not Java, but Malaka, which is just what
Moens does; and that after correcting the first Ché-po in the
T'ang annals account of the journey to Moti-p’o! After
this he finds the capital Ché-p’o in Kédah relying to some
extent on I-tsing’s statements regarding Kie-tch’a and for
the rest on the astronomical datum, both already discussed.

Some other considerations are also urged by Moens in
support of the Kédah site for the capital of Ché-p’o. They
are: (1) The valley of To-ong-pou-lo which must be
crossed to reach Ché-p’o according to the T’ang annals may
be found in the valley of the Sai Buri (the Siamese name of
the Kédah river), Sai Buri (Siamese) being an acceptable
(aanvaardbaar) translation of the Malay Tanjongpura. (2) Of
the two large mountains mentioned earlier in the journey,
Tcheng-mi and Cho-ti, the second name is recognised by
Moens in Bukit (Putri) Yatee to the north of Kédah.
(3) Lastly, the district of Lang-pi-ya where the king of Ché-
p’o frequently went according to the New T'ang annals, to
look at the sea, may be recognised in the land of the Rambai
the hills to the east of Kédah, and Rambai, says
Moens, ‘is a passable phonetic equivalent of Lang-pi-ya.”
All these agreements between modern names in this loca-
lity and those recorded by the Chinese centuries ago seem
to be more than merely accidental (meer dan. toevallig
schint). We agree, though in a different sense from that of
Moens.

The oldest Chi-p'o is, according to Moens, identical
with Fa-hien’s Ye-p'o-ti, a correct transcription of Yava-
dvipa. The usual identification of Yavadvipa with Java
rests on a current misinterpretation of the Canggal inscrip-
tion of Safijaya of $. 654 (A.D. 732). OF this inscription
Moens says: ‘In it Yavadvipa is mentioned not as though

Google
GEOGRAPHY OF MALAY PENINSULA & ARCHIPELAGC 39

Safijaya was there, when he founded the linga-temple on the
Wukir and set up the inscription in commemoration of the
fact, but as the place where his family played a part before
migration to Java." He lays stress on the expression
-duiparam of stanza 7, and says that it refers to Yava-
dvipa of old (van weleer), the same as is found mentioned in
the Ramayana. He continues: ‘“‘There (in Ché-p'o) was
(in the 7th century) the miraculous temple of Sambhu. In
fact, that Siva temple is not the lifga-temple of the Wukir,
and Krom wondered if it was! It stood however not else-
where in Java as this scholar thought, but on Yavadvipa.
The eighth and ninth strophe continue that it was on that
boasted island Yava that Sannaha reigned and died.
There was it too that Sajijaya followed him (st. 10)
and not on Java. There was it (st. 12) that ‘people slept on
the royal road without fear of robbers or other danger.’
The safety there was (naturally) so great as at Ché-
when in 674 A.D. Queen Sima (according to the New T'ang
Annals) reigned and where ‘even things dropped on the
road were not taken up’.""**

The last remark about Ché-p’o is nothing to the point.
Tt cannot settle the question whether Malaka or Java is the
original Ché-p’o (Yavadvipa), and it will apply to which-
ever land we take to be this. If anything, the similarity
between the twelfth verse of the inscription found in Java
and the Chinese account of Sima’s reign will raise a presump-
tion that both refer to the island, and no other place, and
this is the usual view Moens seeks to demolish.

The main question, however, is whether Moens’
contention that the “Yavadvipa of old’ was some land other
than that of the linga-temple of Wukir has any substance in
it. I think it has none. The past tense form of sit (in
verse 7) on which Moens lays so much stress has always
attracted the attention of scholars; but Moen himself ignores
the, present tense forms of pati applied to Sannaha in verse

8, bhramati to the world on the occasion of his death in
verse 9, udbhavati and éasti to Safijaya himself in verses 10
and II.

Why the poet preferred the form dsit when asti would
have served his purpose in every way, Kern said he did not
know;* and we are in no better position. But of the migra-
tion of Safijaya or of his father, or of the transfer of their
power from one centre to another, there is not a word in
the inscription. And the history which Moens invents for
supporting this hypothesis has no support outside his own
imagination. He suggests that the elliptical passage
tadamarai...dinoparjitam (verse 7) containg a euphe-
mistic reference to Safijaya being dispossessed of his inal
territory; he also suggests that the account of Safijaya’s
exploits in the Carita Parahyangan should be taken to mean
that ‘Safijaya undertook his campaigns from Ché-p'o and
when in the end he had the worst of it, he fled to Java’;
neither of these suggestions can be accepted, and in the
Carita Parahyangan the career of Safijaya is marked by
striking victories everywhere and Srivijaya suffers defeat at
is hands, and not the other way round as Moens wants us
to suppose. Further, the, Carita starts Safijaya on his con-
quering career from Galoch just as it makes him return to
the same place at the end of his campaigns.*?

Analysing Fa-hien’s account of his ill-starred journey
from Ceylon to China, Moens argues that he might have
touched on the west coast of Malaka, crossed over to the
east coast by one of the land routes across the isthmus
commonly used at the time, and sailed again from the east
coast of the peninsula. He admits that no positive evidence
emerges from Fa-hien’s detailed account to show that
Ye-p'o-ti represents Malaka, but, he adds, ‘certainly there
is no reason to infer with any greater probability that he

travelled throughout Java.’ That is a fair statement of the
case, and we are content to leave it thus, only pointing out
that other students of Fa-hien’s travels, witness the map
in Giles’ Travels of Fa-Hsien, have understood Fa-hien’s
account to mean an all sea route broken by a five months’
sojourn at Java.

It is unnecessary to discuss here the, location of the fifth
century Kelatan (Ho-lo-tan) and Tch’e-t’ou of the sixth
century from which Moens seeks support for Yavadvipa
being considered the same as Ché-p’o and Malaka; these
matters have been dealt with earlier. But one statement of
Moens connected with his plausible suggestion that the
usual route to China from India lay across the neck of the
Malay peninsula deserves some attention. He says: ‘Pos-
sibly Fa-Hien passed via. Ligor and Gunavarman via.
Kédah; the first came across few men of the faith
(hinayanists) and many heretical Brahamans,** the second
travelled by a purely Buddhist town, a contrast not to be
expected to have come about in a short span of ten years,
if the descriptions of the two monks referred to one and
the same place."’ This apparently strong argument totally
ignores the fact that all the accounts we have of Gunavarman
ascribe to him the credit of converting to Buddhism the land
of his sojoum before his departure from it for China.
Moens’ geography seems to exert a rather powerful influence
on his history.

It is needless to follow Moens’ speculations on the
identity of Ptolemy's labadiou with Malaka, and of his
Argyré with Ligor, for they rest primarily on the assumption
that Yavadvipa is Malaka (Ye-p'oti). The mention of gold
among the products of this land by Ptolemy, the Ramayana
and other sources is taken to point to Sumatra or Malal
but not Java; as Krom has pointed out,* this argument is

pression to include Parsis and Saivites (p. 396).

not 80 formidable as it looks, for in the Canggal inscription
found in Java the island is said to be rich in gold, so that,
rightly or wrongly, Java had this reputation; again the
Yavadvipa would likewise be unaccountable, for yava does
not grow either in Sumatra or in Java.

[Concluded from JGIS., VI, 2]

After the reign of Jayavarman III (854-877) the son and
successor of Jayavarman Il, a new dynasty rose to power.
The founder of this dynasty, Indravarman (877-889) was
only distantly related to Jayavarman II through his wife.
The most illustrious sovereign of this dynasty is Yagovarman
(889-910), the son and successor of Indravarman, who has
celebrated his name in many inscriptions and in his new
capital—Yagodharapura, the famous Angkor Thom (Nagara
Dhama). The most noteworthy of his inscriptions are
digraphic, i.e., they give the same text in two scripts,
South Indian (Pallava—the usual script of Cambodian
epigraphy) and North Indian (somewhat akin to Bengali).
These inscriptions show an intimate knowledge of Sanskrit
literature. In the inscription of the High Priests of Deva
Raja we find that Yagovarman constructed the Central
Mount as the shrine of that tutelary deity of the realm.
Till recently the Central Mount (called central because it
was in the centre of the city) was supposed to be the great
tower of the Bayon, the great temple which dominates
Angkor Thom today, about which scholars gave their
opinion that it was commenced as a Buddhist shrine by
Jayavarman Il and finished as a Siva temple by
Yagovarman. This Central Mount has now been identified
by M. Goloubew with the Siva temple crowning the wooded
hill Phnom Bakhen near the southern gate of the present
Angkor Thom. This identification was based on the fact
that Phnom Bakhen marks the exact centre of a rectangle
covering an area of 16 kilometres and bounded on the west
and north by broad ditches which have now been turned
into rice fields, while the eastern side follows a line parallel
with the Siem-reap river which has been deflected from its
natural course to form a sort of moat. Later excavations

in 1931-32 have revealed the fact that the hill of Phnom
Bakhen is surrounded by numerous water-reservoirs. Their
symmetrical arrangement confirms the existence in former
times of axial causeways starting from the foot of the hill
and running in the four directions as one would expect in
the case of a Central Mount. On the north side too traces
of a ditch faced with stone have been discovered together
with remnants of bridges.

This dynasty came to close with Iéanavarman Il, the
second son of Yagovarman. The crown passed on to
another stranger, Jayavarman IV (928-942 A.C.) whose only
claim to the throne was perhape through his wife—a sister
of Yasovarman, He might have been proclaimed king in
the life-time of his nephew as some inscriptions of his tem-
porary capital Koh-ker would make his reign begin from 921,
not 928 A.D. His queen, whose name was Mehendradevi,
had a son by a previous marriage, and this son Rajendra-
varman (944-968 A.D.) succeeded to the throne after his
half-brother Hargavarman II (942-944 A.D.)

Towards the close of the 10th century, in the reign of
Jayavarman V (968-1001) the son and successor of Rajendra-
varman, Mahayana Buddhism grows in importance in
Kambuja. The minister of this monarch brought from
foreign lands large number of Mahayana texts. The
Hema-éritiga-giri, identified with Ta Kev is tentatively assign-
ed to the reign of Jayavarman V by M. Ccedés. This girl
was according to an inscription of Jayavarman V, the seat
of the Inspector of Qualities and Defaults, The next reign
was abruptly brought to an end by another dynastic revolu-
tion in 1002. Siryavarman I (1002-1049) who seized the throne
by force of arms, was not a direct descendant of his imme-

diate predecessors Jayaverman V and Udayadityavarman. |.
From some Pali chronicles of Laos M. (oedés derives the
information that king Jivaka of Nagara Sri Dharma Raja
(Ligor in the Malay Peninsula) had conquered considerable
portions of Siam and that the son of king Jivaka became king
of Kambuja. By comparing dates M. Goedés comes to the
conclusion that the son of the king of Sri Dharma Raja who
had become king of Kambuja could be no other than Sirya-
varman I in whose reign Dvaravati (Siam) was annexed to
Cambodia. Nagara Sri Dharma was a centre of
Buddhism in the Malay Peninsula and the new ruler of
Kambuja (Siryavarman 1) was a fervent Buddhist as his
posthumous name of Nirvanapada clearly indicates. He
also introduced among the royal titles the Malay title of
Tuan (Lord). Phimanakas (Akasa Vimana sky-lower of the
Silpa Sastras) was built during his reign. It was supposed
that Jayaviravarman was an earlier name of Siryavarman I.
Tt now appears that Jayaviravarman and Siryavarman I were
two rival kings of Kambuja in the same period—Siryavarman
in the long rum getting the better of his rival.

During the reign of his successor Udayadityavarman If
the last monarch mentioned in the inscription of the High
Priests which covers the period from Jayavarman II to this
reign (latter part of eighth century to the middle of eleventh
century), was built the Baphuon—one of the gems of Khmer
architecture. According to M. Qcedés, Baphuon may be the
corrupt form of Brah (or Vrah—great) Bhuvana. Its full name
may have been Vrah Bhuvana Tilaka—Bhuvana-tilaka being
a type of building mentioned in the Silpa Sastras. M. Coedés
thinks that very probably Baphuon is identical with the
Svarnadri of the inscriptions. This Svarnadri was the
“Copper Tower’ which so much impressed Cheou Ta-kouan
(the comparison of the Chinese envoy of Kublai Khan) who
visited Cambodia towards the end of the 13th century.

Another dynastic change took place towards the end of
the IIth century A.D, Jayavarman VI seized the throne
and for a short period there seems to have been two rival
kings in Kambuja—Hargavarman {II and Jayavarman VI.

Saryavarman II (1112-1152) of this dynasty of Mahidhara-
pura was a great builder as well a» a warlike monarch.
The most famous temple of Cambodia, the Vignu temple
of Angkor Vat, was built during the reign of Siryavarman II
and completed by his successor. Several scholars are of
the opinion that Angkor Vat (a comparatively recent name
meaning ‘Palace-Monastery’) was originally a mausoleum
finished immediately after Siryavarman II's death. The fact
that the entrance is on the west, they think, proves conclu-
sively that it was a mausoleum. M. Ccedés, on the other
hand, does not believe that Angkor Vat should be considered
as essentially different from other Cambodian temples. He
would rank it among that numerous class of Khmer,—Cham
and Javanese temples in which, as is concltsively proved by
epigraphical evidence, deceased rulers were worshipped
under the aspect of divinities of the Brahmanical and
Buddhist pantheon. Angkor Vat is a Buddhist monastery
today. But it was not so in the beginning. The principal
image in the central shrine has vanished, but a set of images
of the avataras of Vignu (Narasimha, Varaha, Matsya and
Kirmavataras, etc.) still remains as vestiges of the original
statutory of the great Vignu temple. At Angkor Vat too
has been discovered a sacred deposit (gold leaves) in the
foundations right under the central sanctuary at the ground
level of the surrounding country. Similar sacred deposits
have been discovered at the Bayon and another shrine.
M. Gcedés thinks that this arrangement is peculiar to the
type of shrines which we may call ‘temple-mountains’ where
the principal image was placed on the top of a stepped
pyramid. All this confirms his belief that Angkor Vat
should not be placed in a separate category and that it was
a temple with the image of Sidryavarman Il, representing
Vignu, as the presiding deity. Parama-Vignuloka was the
appropriate posthumous title of Siryavarman II.
Jayavarman VII was the last of the great figures of
Cambodian history. He too belonged to the dynasty of
Mahidharapura. New light has been thrown on his early
life by the recent researches of M. Coedés on the Mahidhara-

pura dynasty. On the death of his father Dharanindra-
varman II it seems that Jayavarman for some reason or other
could not obtain possession of the throne which passed to
Yagovarman II. Jayavarman had to live a life of exile in
Campa (Annam), while his wife Jayarajadevi (the daughter
of a Brahman) lived the life of an ascetic in Kambuja. We
read in a badly damaged inscription of the fapasyd of the
princess, of her emaciated limbs, of her tresses converted
into jafa and the teare she shed for her absent lord. On
hearing the news of a conspiracy against the king Jayavarman
hurried back to Campa. But he arrived too late to save
Yaéovarman II from the usurper Tribhuvanadityavarman (a
bhritya or servant of the late king) who now seized the
throne. Jayavarman quietly bided his time and the oppor-
tunity came when the king of Campa invaded Kambuja
and slew the usurper (1177 A.D.)

Both Yagovarman II and Tribhuvanadityavarman were
not known hitherto as rulers of Cambodia. The only thing
that we know about Yagovarman II is that he must have
belonged to the royal family, as he was faithfully served by
the future Jayavarman VII and his son Srindrakumara, and
that he was attacked by a mysterious personage Bharata
Rahu, who is depicted in a bas-relief of Bantay Chmar with
the demoniac features of the mythical Rahu, and saved
through the exertions of Srindrakumara. Shortly afterwards
he was deposed by an usurper who assumed the title of
Tribhuvanadityavarman on seizing the throne. The bas-
reliefe of the Bayon and Bantay Chmar promise light on
this obscure period.

The vicissitudes of his life taught both Jayavarman VII
and his queen Jayarajadevi a new outlook on life which is
reflected in the inscriptions of this reign. One hundred and
two hospitals (drogya-sala) were built in the different
provinces and every year provisions and medicine were
supplied to these hospitals from the royal magazines. In
the hospital inscriptions the king proclaims: “‘It is the
sufferings (of the subjects) of the state which make the
kings suffer—not their own pain.” These inscriptions are

fervently Buddhist in tone and the king and the queen were
both devoted adherents of Mahayana.

Jayavarman VII was also a great conqueror. Campa
as well as Pegu were annexed by him to Kambuja. A large
part of the Malay Peninsula also acknowledged his sway.
Finally the great building activity of Jayavarman VII deserves
special mention. The Bayon (Vaijayanta?), next to
Angkor Vat, the greatest temple in Cambodia, is now attri-
buted to him. It has been the subject of so much contro-
versy of late that it is worthwhile giving some details
about it.

The Bayon which adorms the centre of Angkor Thom
was supposed all along to have been built by Yasovarman
in the ninth century A.D. In 1925 M. Finot discovered in
the shrine images of Lokeévara (Avalokiteévara) disfigured
and carefully concealed. He believed that the Bayon was
begun by Jayavarman Il, who was supposed to be a
Buddhist as Java, the place he came from, had been identi-
fied with Zabaj (Srivijaya) the stronghold of Mahayana
Buddhism. In 1926 M. Philippe Stern announced that the
Bayon, supposed to be the Central Mount of the inecriptions,
could not have been the centre of Angkor Thom in Yaéo-
varman’s reign. He assigned the Bayon to the reign of
Siryavarman I—the first Buddhist monarch of Kambuja
(early IIth century). In 1928 the Sanskrit inscriptions placed
at the corners of the city-wall of Angkor Thom were decip-
hered by M. Ccedés. He found that these inscriptions
belonged to the reign of Jayavarman VII who is described
as having constructed the high city ramparts and dug the
deep moat round Yagodharapuri. This must have been
done after Yaéodharapuri (Angkor Thom) had been pillaged
and partially destroyed by the Campa invaders in 1177 A.D.
Now these city-walls and gates have many features in
common with the architectural designs and ornamental work
of the Bayon, Bantay Chmar, etc. The inscriptions on the
walls of the Bayon and Bantay Chmar also belong to the
reign of Jayavarman VII. Some bas-eliefs of Bantay
Chmar and the Bayon have now been satisfactorily explained

as depicting incidente of Jayavarman VII's career. The
discovery of a Yasovarman Il, one of the immediate prede-
cessors of Jayavarman VII, from newly deciphered inscrip-
tione as well as a bas-relief at Bantay Chmar, showing his
rescue from Bharata Rahu by Srindarakumara (the son of
Jayavarman VII), obviates the necessity of dragging in the
Yagovarman I of the Sth century.

Then, from the point of view of the development of
Kambuja art and architecture, archeologists have been
doubting for some time the sequence in which scholars like
Philippe Stern had wished to place the three principal monu-
ments of Kambuja—Baphuon (close of the tenth century),
the Bayon (beginning of the eleventh century—Saryavarman
I's reign), Angkor Vat (middle of the twelfth century), Why
should Bayon with all its imperfections be placed between
the two gems of Cambodian architecture? M. Coedés would
attribute the imperfections of the Bayon not to precocity (as
M. Finot had proposed to do) but to senility.

The Bayon enshrines the statues of many members of
Jayavarman VII's family. Why should the greatest monarch
of Cambodia put the statues of his family in a shrine built
by a previous sovereign?

A basrelief of the Bayon gives an almost exact
representation of the towers of Angkor Vat. Ornamental
stones of Baphuon have been used in building the Bayon.

Archzeologists would now put the principal monuments
of Cambodia in the following chronological order :—
Baphuon (second half of the eleventh century—the
Svamidri of Udayadityavarman II); Angkor Vat (middle of
the twelfth century—reigns of Siryavarman Ill and Dhara-
nindravarman Il); the Bayon (towards the end of the twelfth
century—reign of Jayavarman VII).

Quite recently has been discovered in a pit under the
central tower of the Bayon a large-sized image of the
Buddha canopied by the hood of a polycephalous Naga. It
is twelve feet in height without the pedestal (fifteen feet
with the pedestal). It is now certain that this image
of the Buddha was the object of worship first

enshrined in the principal sanctuary of the Bayon.
It is reckoned among the finest pieces of sculpture
found in Cambodia. In the Indian Art and Letters, 1937,
M. Paul Mus writes that this Buddha has been declared by
M. Qcedés to be a statue of Jayavarman VII deified as a
Buddha. The great stone faces of the Bayon towers (about
two hundred of them decorate the exterior of the royal
temple of Jayavarman VII) are now interpreted as colossal
portraits (in stone) of that great emperor representing
Avalokiteévara. The four faces on each tower mean facing
in all directione,—omnipresent and omniscient, and Avalo-
kiteévara in the Lotus of the Good Law, the Mahayana text
Par excellence, is adored as omnipresent and omniscient—
all the Buddhas being manifestations of his infinite mercy.
Jayavarman VII, a pious and powerful Buddhist emperor,
would naturally like to be regarded by posterity as a mani-
festation of this great Bodhisattva. A detailed study of the
various portions of this monarch in the reliefs of Angkor
Thom has led M. Qcedés to the conclusion that it is Jayavar-
man VII himeelf, in the guise of Avalokitesvara, who domi-
nates the Bayon and the ruins of Angkor Thom of today.

Relation Between Indian and Indonesian
Culture

By O. C. Gangoly

The approximate date of the “‘colonisation” and the
spread of Indian culture across the Indian Ocean has been
the subject of keen debate amongst scholars. When the
text of the Arthasastra was published, some scholars (Jacobi
and others) suggested that a passage in that text distinctly re-
commended (as a piece of kingly obligation) the foundation
of new places of habitation or colonies in already existing
provinces by vomiting out inhabitants from one’s own
country in order to people new colonized tracts or by invit-
ing the flow of foreigners into one’s own countries (““Bhita-
pdrvam-abhiatapirvam vd janapadam paradesdpavahanena
svadesabhisyandavamanena va nivesayet’”, Arthasastra,
Book II, Ch. I, 1, Janapada-nivega). Louis Finot in an
adroitly argued paper’ contested this suggestion, that
the passage in question could be taken to offer a direct
testimony to the commencement of Indian culture in the
neighbouring peninsula.” Finot’s paper has not unfortunate-

BEFEO, Tome XII, 1912, pp. 1-4.

2 Finot’s views can be gathered from the following remarks:
“That the Dekkhan was Brahmanised by this epoch (ie. of Kautilya)
one could admit; but Brahmanisation docs not mean occupation, and
it is to be believed that this country, all Brahmanised as it was,
offered yet the vast spaces to interior colonisation. It is with that
only, according to our opinion, that the Arthatastra occupies itself,
because if it had in view establishments outside India, it could not
omit to lay down particular rules for the solution of the many prob-
lems which were involved in the installation of a civilized minority
in the midst of a barbarous population” (Tr. by the present writer)

ly attracted the attention of Indian scholars. About twenty-
eight years have elapsed since the matter was debated.
Since then, a large volume of records has been unearthed
bearing on the origin and history of Indian culture in
Burma, Malaya, Siam, Cambodia, Campa, Java, Sumatra and
Borneo. Quaritch Wales’ recent explorations in Malaya
have also brought forward some archeological evidences to
establish the fact that from very early times, Takkola (on
the western coast of Malaya on the Bay of Bengal) and
Tamralinga (on the eastern coast of Malaya on the Bay of
Bandon, later, the site of Nakon Sri Thammarat) formed
two important outposts through which Indian culture
radiated and spread over to Cambodia, Siam, Campa and
other parts of South-Eastern Asia.’ In an illuminating
geographical study‘ contributed by Sylvain Lévi, that
great savant of Indology has been able to establish on
data extracted from the texts of the Mahabharata, the
Ramayana, the Maha-Niddesa, and the Brhat-katha that
Indian merchants, navigators, and adventurers were familiar
with the products of Burma and the Malaya Peninsula from
very early times and that some parts of the trans-Gangetic
Peninsula [e.g- Suvarnakudya, Suvannakuta, Subanna-
bhimi (some parts of Burma), Takkolam, Tamlin (Tamra-
lingam), and Javam] were known to Indian authors from at
least the first century of the Christian Era.’ We may goa

step further and claim that having regard to the fact that
these Far Eastern ports and tracts bear Indian names, in
fairly early texts, it may be reasonable to conclude that the
“Indianization”’ of these tracts must have begun previous
to the first century A.D. But the point we are concerned
with here, is not so much the ancient chronology of the
Indianization of the regions beyond the seas, as the nature
of the relationship of the so-called “‘colonial’’ Indian culture
with its parent stem. Generally speaking, it is usual to
regard colonial cultures, as somewhat inferior to the parent-
al culture in its place of origin,—on account of the fact
that it is the second-rate men belonging to the surplus popu-
lation that are usually sent abroad to people and develop
distant colonies. And, asa rule, the colonized countries
are scarcely regarded as strongholds, or significant points
of expansion of parental culture on equal footing with the
original sources.

To these general rules the expansion of Indian culture
across the Indian Ocean offers a very significant exception.
The pioneers who set out to plant the seeds of Indian
culture, as well as those who permanently took up their
abode in various cultural kingdoms of Greater India and
developed Indian culture to a level of equal eminence
with that of the mother-continent, were not worthless ne’er-
do-wells, or second-rate men, who could be elbowed out
of the Indian Continent to eke out a fortune, or seek a
chance success abroad. The representatives of various
clans of learned Brahmins (such as those of the Agastys
gotra, or the Kaundinya-gotra) who carried the torch of
Indian religious culture to distant countries were, undoubt-
edly, worthy and very distinguished representatives, the
finest types of Indian intellectual and spiritual giants. The

the above extracts it is clear that according to Sylvain Lévi,
an author writing in India could not have prepared the list of the sca-
ports vf the Far East, such as we find in the Néldesa, before the first
century A.D.

Keatriya Princes, probably some branch of the Pallava
dynasty, who founded, built, and organized political king-
doms and culture-centres in various tracts of Cambodia
(Fou-nan) were enterprising groups of typical Indian
Princes of remarkable talent, industry, and organizing
ability. The successive chains of Brahmin ministers
ed the Cambodian kings (e. siverKaivalve
rya, Hiranyaruci, Isai arti, Sadi » Sankar
Pandita, Divakara-Pandita and a host of others) who adi
ed and guided the polity, the military exploits, and the reli-
gious foundations of their protégés, were learned and wise
men of remarkable talents and equipments. Likewise, the
heroic types of Indian Princes (probably some branch of the
Calukya dynasty as suggested by their characteristic virudas,
“Uttunga-deva') who founded and developed glorious king-
doms in Java were brilliant men of sterling qualities
of head and heart and were justly deified as Deva-
rajas or ‘Divine Kings” after their death. Similarly, the
group of heroic Indian Princes of the Sailodbhava or
dynasty who founded the great oversea Empire
‘a were personalities of exceptional talent and

brilliance.

That Sanskrit learning was kept up at a high pitch of
excellence and was understood and cultivated by a large
number of people in Cambodia, Sumatra and Java is proved
by numerous inscriptions in Sanskrit, the high literary merit

of which excels the continental compositions and deserves
high praise. Some of these inscriptions offer valuable data
for the history of Sanskrit literature. Yaéovarman, king of
Cambodia, and the builder of Angkor Thom, is said to have
written a commentary on the Mahabhaeya.* Valuable

and rich collections of books were maintained in the
“Pustakagramas" or the ‘Hermitages of Books’ or Libraries.
Endowments were provided for regular or periodical recita-
tions of the Puranas and the Epics. That some cities in
the colonies were specialized centres of some phases of
Indian culture of greater importance than the continental
centres may be illustrated from the fact that Atiéa
(Dipankara Srijfiana), the great Buddhist Patriarch, had to
reside for twelve years in Suvarnadvipa, then the head-
quarters of Mahayana Buddhism, in order to master the
teachings of Acarya Dharmakirti, the High Priest of
Suvarnadvipa. Some of the establishments in various parts
of Greater India were important centres of Tantric cults,
contributing new and original developments. The two
separate and sectarian cults of Siva and Buddha attained a
happy fusion in the Siva-Buddhist cult of Java. Burma’
and Siam* have made original and distinguished contribu-
tions to Pali Buddhism and to Buddhist Literature. In the
spheres of architecture, sculpture, applied arts, and
crafts, the Indian continent must have sent some of its
greatest masters to the ‘‘colonies’ in order to cater to the
artistic needs and to carry out the architectural ambitions

of the Indian Princes in Indonesia and to fashion innumer-
able images of the highest sculptural merits, for the use of
religious devotees. Boro-Budur, of Java,—the ‘Parthenon
of the East,” and Angkor Vat, the chef d'oeuvre of
Cambodia, to name only two of the supreme masterpieces,
eclipse anything that has been achieved on the soil of India
itself. The brilliant schools of sculpture in Java, in
m, in Cambodia, and in Malaya likewise put to the shade
the schools of Image-making in continental India. These
evidences unquestionably point to the fact that the Indians
of the continent assiduously kept up the values and stand-
ards of Indian culture in the so-called colonies at a high
level of excellence, and in some phases (e.g. in Plastic Arts)
outshone the achievements at their original birth-place.
They did not look upon these distant centres of Indian
culture across the seas—as mere inferior reflexions of
Indian culture—d d second-hand from cotinental
sources, but, in many instances as independent seats and
sources, as they developed the oversea tracts (“‘doipdntara’’)
into the most important limbs and significant centres of the
best phases of Indian culture. The so-called colonies
were regarded as integral parts of the Great Indian Conti-
nent—so as to make India and Greater India—as one unified
and uniform texture woven by the best Indian hands—
whether living at home, or abroad. This view of the rela-
tionship of the continental and the so-called colonial
culture receives credence if we consider some of the texts
of the Puranas.

According to the geography of the Puranas, India Proper
is designated as “‘Jambu-dvipa,”’ while the total extension
and limits of ‘‘Bharata-varga’”’ include the nine additional
territories (nava bhedan) across the Indian Ocean, “‘each i
accessible from the other’ (agamyah parasparam) being
“separated by the barriere of the seas’ (samudrdntarita).
Thus in the Markandeya Purana, Kraugtuki addresses
Markandeya in the following words:—"Lord! you have

to me in detail Bharata with its distinguishing parts (bheda),
their situations and extensions, specifying the territories
and the mountai To this Markandeya replied :—
“‘Bharata-varga, you should understand, consists of nine
distinct territories, separated by the seas and each
inaccessible from the other: Indra-dvipa, Kaéeruman,
Tamra-varna (? Tamraparni), Gabhastiman, Naga-dvipas
Saumya, Gandharva, Varuna (? Borneo)—these are the
nine islands girt by the seas

Even if all the nine islands cannot be satisfactorily
identified, the description of their being separated from
each other by seas appears to suggest the picture of an
“Ieland-India,” the ‘Greater India’ of our modern scholars.
In the Vamana Purana (Ch. 13, I-11), after de: ing the
component territories of Jambudvipa, nine territories of
Bharata-varga (Greater India) are likewise indicated. Here
the names of nit nds are slightly different: Indra-
dvipa, Kaseruna, Tamaraparna, Gabhastiman, Naga-dvipa,
Kataha, Simhala, Varuna and Kumara.’ In this list,

Peninsula, having its chief city of the same name
(Katahanagara) with its neighbouring city known ae Ganga-
nagara, both of which were besieged and destroyed by
Rajendra-Cola. As suggested by Dr. D. C. Sircar,!? the
name of Kataha must have been introduced in the Vamana
Purana ‘‘after Kajaha became famous under the Sailendra
Emperors in the eighth century."”

12a As regards the significance of the term Dvipantaram, we have
interesting light thrown on the word from a very curious source. In
a Sanskrit-Chinese Dictionary compiled in Central Asia between
the 7th and 8th centuries, reference is made to the countries situated
in the Southern Seas as Jipattala, which Sylvain Lévi has restored to
Doipantara and which Lévi paraphrases as “another isle” or “another
continent.” According to Sylvain Lévi, this term properly designates
the Indian Archipelago and the neighbouring countries” (‘Le nom de
¥ archipel Indien en sanscrit,’ Actes dw XVIlle Congrés International
des Orientalistes, Oxford, p. 131),

or territories (nava-bhed@) girt by the seas."* What we
are seeking to establish is that the nine islands of
Greater India were regarded as integral part of Bharata-
varga, and an equal sanctity attached to the component
parts of Island-In as strongholds of national Indian
culture—where Indians lived, fought, traded and performed
their religious duties (yajfia, tapas, etc.,) and they were
looked upon as suitable areas for their cultural activity
(karma-bhami) on an equal footing with any part of India
Proper (Jambu-dutpa). From this point of view, a passage
in the Vamana Purana (Ch. 13, 13) is very significant:
‘The nine islands have been sanctified by the performance
of sacrifices,"* by warfare,’* by trade,’* and diverse other
cultural activities’ (‘‘liyd-yuddha-vanijyadyaih karmma-
bhih krtapdvanah"). Now, if we take one by one each

In describing the oversea territories of Bhiratavarsa, the Agnipurina
(Ch. 119, Slokas 27 & 28) refers to a peak, as the boundary of a tract,

peak in question. Could it be the peak of Kedah in Upper Malaya?

of these items, which, according to the Vamana Purana,
imparts sanctity to the oversea tracts, we have actual ill
tration and proof of each item. Thus as regards ijyd
yajfia or sacrifices)—we find, this is corroborated by the
Yapa inscription of Milavarman discovered in Borneo
which commemorates the performance of a vahusuvarnaka
yajfia. As regards battles and warfare, this is attested by
numerous battles at various places in Malaya and Indo-
nesia including the severe conflicts of the Sailendras and
the Colas. As regards trade and commercial activity—
that a brisk trade and mercantile intercourse were carried
on between India and Indonesia is borne out by numerous
evidences in the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the two Tamil
Epics, Manimekhalai and Silappadikaram, and in the Katha
saritsagara some of which we shall presently cite here.

Put into modern parlance, the canon of sanctity laid
down in the Vamana Purdéna would mean—wherever the
Indians have lived, whenever they have rendered their
homage to the Divinity through sacrificial rites,—there
they have built up a New India. This short, the
principle of Indian colonization.

This canon of sanctity prescribed in the Va@mana Purana
appears to meet and fully answer Finot's objections—that
the Arthagastra could not possibly recommend a colony
of Indians to emigrate across the seas and establish them-
selves in tracts, densely populated by non-Aryan and
aboriginal inhabitants as these tracts would be unsuitable
venues or fields for Indian cultural expansion. By the
time of the earliest Puranas these oversea tracts must have
been thoroughly Indianized and adopted and sanctified as
karmabhimis or appropriate areas of Indian cultural
activity. The point established is that the intervening
not prevent the distant territories in Island-
India—being actually placed on the map of Indian
culture. That Indians have throughout the centuries re-
garded oversea territories of Bharatavarga as essential
and integral parts of India of which Jambudvipa was only

another segment, may be, a big segment,—is further corro-
borated by the testimony of Arab geographers. Thus
Masiidi in his work “Meadows of Gold” (943 A.D.) thus
indicates the geographical limits of India: ‘‘India is a vast
country extending over sea and land and mountains. It
borders on the country of Zabag, (i.e. Sumatra or Greater
Java) which is the kingdom of the Maharaja, the king of
the islands . the Sailendra Emperor). Zabag which
separates India from China is comprised within the former
country (i.e. India)"".""

Further corroboration of this view is offered by a
curious but a very significant sloka in the Fifth Act of the
Kaumudi-mahotsava, the upper limit of the date of which
has been accepted by scholars as the seventh century.
The Sloka describes the shady and amorous adventures
of a fashionable rake, a gallant sensualist who has tasted
the gay life of all the famous cities of India (Bharatavarga),
having visited women in the cities of Ayodhya (Saketa),
Kancipura (Conjeeveram), Pampa (Bellary), Vidiéa
(Besnagar), Kataha-nagara (Keddah, in Malaya Peninsula)
and in Kundina (probably a city in Vidarbha).’*

18 The Kamasitra of Vitsyayana, and other cognate literature,
the Arthagastra, and the Sanskrit kavyas and the dramas offer abun-
dant evidence of the establishments of gay women and hetarae in all
cities as essential part of a cultured city life. Even in the Ramayana
we get a glimpse of the existence of gay women in Ayodhya itself—
and Dajaratha, realizing that the retinues of exiled Rama will find
their life in banishment very forlorn and drab, without these ameni-
ties of city life—enjoins that the betarae should be sent out from
Ayodhya to this place of banishment.

Here, in this picture of a Rake's Progress, the object
is to mention all the great cities of India famous for their

Vita, as a gallant and fast young man who has acquired considerable
experience of the ways of hetarae frequently occurs in the Indian
dramas (e.g. Mrcchakatika). The carliest definition of a Vita is that
given in the Kamasitra, (Ch. IV, 46): “Bhukta-vibbavastu gunavin
sakalatro vete gosthyamica vabumatastadripajivi ca viteb.” ‘An accom-
plished person who has spent through all his patrimony and who
lives by associating with hetaraes and their lovers and club-men,’

rendered as ‘being baffled in his pranks in Siketa.’ I am indebted

gay life, where gentlemen of pleasure could seek satisfac-
tion. Of the six cities mentioned in the verse Saketa,
Kaficfpura, Pampa, Vidiéa, Kataha and Kundina, the firet
four are very well known. Special significance attaches
to the two last-named cities, Kundina and Kataha.
Kundina is a very little known city, and does not figure
very much in ancient history. We can offer two alternative
identifications. On two inscribed stélés (coming from
Prasat Komphus, and Prah Einkos Cambodia) a place
called Kandin (? Kundina) is mentioned where Divakara-
bhatta, the royal chaplain of King Jayavarman V, built
and endowed a sanctuary of Siva in 894 Saka (972 A.D.)
The place came also to be known under the name of
Madhu-vana or Madhu-kanana, the ‘‘Bower of Bliss." The
date of the Kaumudi-mahotsava could hardly be pulled
down as late as the last part of the l0th or the beginning
of the Ith century, a chronology necessitated by the fact
that Kandin does not leap into the pages of history before
972 A.D. Besides, however intriguing the name, Madhu-
vana was after all a small provincial town (perhaps a large
village) and never appears to have achieved the status of
a major city, such as would attract visitors from India
Proper, in search of a gay life—in this far-off ‘Bower of
Bliss’. We have, therefore, to seek an alternative identi-
fication which the text of the Kathdsaritsdgara offers. “The
Ocean of the Streams of Story’ composed by Somadeva
(C. 1073 A.D.) thrice mentions the city of Kundina: (a) in
the story of Nagasvamin, a Bramhana from a city called
Kundina,”* (b) in the story of the seven Bramhanas who

Einkosei is discussed in BEFEO., XXX, p. 224.

devoured a cow in time of famine and (c) in the story
of Kanakavarga and Madanasundari.”* In the last-named
story, Kundina is referred to as a prosperous and wealthy
city,” in the province of Vidarbha (Vidarbha-vigaya-vigaya-
Sritam), and may well be the city of gaiety, suggested in the
text of our drama.

As regards the city of Kataha, mentioned in the verse,
ever since Coedés wrote his epoch-making article: ‘Le
Royaume de (ri-Vijaya’** identifying the city as one of the
main seats of the Sailendra Kings of the Empire of Sri-
Vijaya, which comprised the greater part of the Malaya
Peninsula, several Indonesian islands including, Sumatra,
Banka, and Java, quite a formidable literature has grown
up over the problem of identifying the exact site of Kataha-
nagara which in ancient Tamil literature is also known
under the name of KaJagam and Kadaram.”*

It is very probable, that Kataha (Kalagam, Kadaram)
was an important sea-port and a brisk centre of trade, at
least from the third century A.D., long before the rise of
the Sailendras. According to Prof. nta Sastri, on

the authority of the text of the Pattinappalai (one of the
early Tamil Sangam works), “‘Kalagam (=Kataha) stands
forthe name of a place in constant trade relation with
Pattinam, or Kaveripatnam, the celebrated port of the early
Cola monarchs of the Sangam age. And the mention of
Kalagam which must mean Kadaram or nothing, in this
early poem of the second or third century A.D. is not
without considerable significance to a study of the early
history of the Hindu colonies of the East.” UGIS, V,
p. 129).* That other parts of India were also in frequent
mercantile and adventurous communications with the city
of Kataha appears to be borne out by numerous references
to that oversea city, in more than one stories of the
Kathdsarits@gara. These references appear to establish
that Kataha was not only a city where a brisk trade was
carried on in the sale and purchase of jewels,?’ to which
merchants from India frequently resorted in search of
fortune, but it was also a “home of all manner of felicities”*
(Ketanam Sarva-sampadam) the amenities of which attracted
young men from India seeking pleasure, as the verse
under discussion suggests. The principal port of em-
barkation for northerners sailing to Kataha—was the old
port of Tamralipti (Tamluk). Various passages of the text of
Kathdsaritsdgara leave no doubt as regards the fact that the
people of India thought nothing of making frequent voyages
to Kataha. Very well-known is the story of the foolish

26 Gerini has suggested (Researches, p. 570, nm.) that Katiha
is referred to by Ptolemy under the form of Ko-tat, Kau-tek Kiu-te,
or Kortatha. He also suggests that Kataha was taken by Fan-man the
gallant king of Fu-nan (Cambodge), who reigned between 200-230
AD. as referred to by the Chinese History of the Liang Dynasty.

27 The precious stones which were the chief articles of commerce
of Katahanagara were probably derived from the neighbouring peak
vf Kedah (Gunang Cherai). Colonel Low, cited by Gerini (Researches
on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia, p. 485, n. 2) says “that
large crystals of quartz, gold and tin are to be found there.”

merchant who went to the island of Kataha to trade. Among
his wares he had a great quantity of fragrant aloes-wood
which he foolishly burnt and made into charcoal and sold
at a cheap price.”* More romantic is the story of Guhasena,
a merchant of Tamralipti, who went to the city of Kataha
for the purpose of trade, notwithstanding the jealousies
of his wife Devasmita who was apprehensive that her hus-
band would be ensnared by some other lady in Kataha.”*
Guhasena took a long time to complete his sales and pur-
chases of jewels and other wares in Kataha"’—a delay which
afforded opportunity to four young merchants of Katiha to
come to Tamralipti to make an unsuccessful attempt to
seduce Devasmita—who subsequently sails to Kataha and
punishes the rascals and brings back her truant husband.
In the story of the Brahman Candrasvamin, it is related that
the father makes several oversea journeys in search of his
son and daughter. From a city named Jalapura on the
shore of the sea, he embarked on a ship and went across to

(Ceylon) in the company of merchants, in search of his
children. That frequent voyages were also made by
merchants to the island of Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra?) at one
time part of the Sailendra Empire, is proved by the story of
Samudra-siira (‘‘the hero of the seas”) apparently a courage-
‘ous sailor-merchant from Hargapura (the city belonging to
King Hargavarman), who was shipwrecked near the coast
of Suvarnadvipa, went to the city of Kalasapura; and came
back with a lot of money, and lived in affluence ever there-
after.**

Reverting to the text of the Kaumudi-mahotsava, we
have cited enough references to establish that Kataha-
nagara as a very popular city was very well known to
Indians who made frequent voyages to the city, which was
thus linked up with India Proper in various ties of mercan-
tile and social interest. That Kataha-nagara, in far-off
Malaya should be mentioned in the verse in the drama in
the same breath with the other well-known cities of India
Proper,—appear to surprisingly corroborate the view we are
seeking to establish, viz., that the territories beyond the
Indian Ocean were regarded as integral parts of Indian
culture-area,—not mere “‘Colonies’’ of Provincial, India-
nized, or Indianesque culture. In fact, they were the very
limbs of India expanding themselves beyond the seas with
all the characteristic and essential qualities of Indian life and
culture growing and sustaining itself in new evironments.

In the field of Epigraphy, the characters of the various
Indian alphabets were adhered to in the oversea tracts and
kingdoms, with very few modifications and developments,
which were natural growths, and were, in no sense, degene-
rations or decadences from original Indian standards.

In the field of Architecture and the Plastic Arts—we also

find a logical, tural, and a continuous development of
the ideals and principles of Indian art as formulated at the
sources, carried out to their utmost perfections in the various
culture-areas in Greater India. Undoubtedly, certain new
forms and new types are achieved in sculptural representa
tions (e.g. in the images of Vignu and Lokeévara in Cambo-
dia), but with the exceptions of a few local ethnic types in
physiognomy, they strictly adhere to the principles and con-
ventions of Indian sculpture and the canons of Indian image-
making evolved on the Continent. In architecture, notwith-
standing, some adoptions here and there, of local structural
forms, the fundamental principles and physiognomy of
Indian temples, shrines, stdpas and other structures are
faithfully followed, and they grow and develop on the same
roads to new developments under novel conditions, and
under luxurious, congenial, and very favourable environ-
ments. As! have shown elsewhere, that with very few
exceptions, there are no features in Indian architecture or
sculpture in the ‘‘Colonies’’ which cannot be explained as
the natural development of essentially Indian forms in a new
environment. Indian art in Siam, Indo-China, Malaya and
the Indian Archipelago is a continuation and logical
development by Indian hands of the principles and symbols
of Indian creation, applied and developed under ‘‘Colonial””
conditions. The art, culture and civilization of India
beyond the seas formed an integral part of the art and
civilization of the Indian continent. The culture-areas
that developed and bore rich fruits in the tras
territories and in the Indian Archipelago, were so many
outlying frontiers and logical expansions of the civilization
of a Greater India stretching itself to the shores beyond the
“moving waves" (calormmi). On the basis of the new
evidences set forth above it may be justly claimed that the
theory of a group of scholars of the so-called “Indian
Influences” in Greater India demands a serious modification.

34 A. Bergaigne (Inscriptions Sanscrites de Campa et Cambodge,
I, p. 170) cites Burnell with approval to suggest that more or less
wholesale emigrations flowed from India to the Indonesian Colonies :
“Burnell etait porte & Vexpliquer par des emigrations opérees plus ou
moins en masse, a la suite de crises religieuses, ou il faisait intervenir
tantot les invasions mussulmanes.” The suggestion that the emigra-
tions were necessitated by Mussalman invasions or Brahmanic perse-
cutions is wholly gratuitous. Dr. Kern, in an article in Dutch on
“Dravidian Folknames of Sumatra’ (Bijdragen, Deel 55, 1903) has
shown that there was a large colony of Tamil workers settled not
only in Sumatra, but also in Java; the Hindu noblemen
employed such labourers and workmen imported from India.
Kempers who does not believe that Indian colonizers planted them-
selves in the colonies in any large numbers, nevertheless concedes that
“their numbers were regularly reinforced by new-comers” (“Cultural
Relations Between India and Java,” Calcutta University Lectures,
1937, Pp. 6)

35 A keen controversy has raged over the problem—as to who
were the actual authors of the architectural and sculptural master-
pieces in Siam, Cambodia, Campi, Malaya (Sri-Vijaya), Sumatra and
Java—a controversy to which two eminent scholars Dr. Bosch and
M. Parmentier have richly contributed (see English translation of
Parmentier’s article: ‘Art of Campa," (Ripam Nos. 15 and 16, pages
41-48), and of Dr. Bosch’s article “A Hypothesis as to the Origin of

Alivardi and his times; By Kalikinkar Datta. Published
by the University of Calcutta, 1939. Pp. xv+302.

Dr. Kalikinkar Datta has already won high reputation
for his scholarly contributions to the history of India in the
eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuric Among
his other publications may be mentioned Studies in the
History of the Bengal Subah, 1740-1770 A.D.; Education
and Social Amelioration of Women in Pre-Mutiny India,
and the Santal Insurrection of 1855-57. In the present work
he traces with equal industry and success the career of the
last powerful Muslim ruler of Bengal, Mirza Muhammad
Ali, better known as Alivardi Khan.

A glance at the excellent bibliography given at the
end is enough to convince the reader that he has utilised all
available sources bearing on his subject. Here the sour-
ces are classified and described under the following heads:
(1) Contemporary Persian Works, (2) Records of the East
India Company, (3) Correspondence of the Council of
Chandernagore, (4) Works of Eighteenth-century European
Writers and Travellers, (5) Contemporary Bengali Literature,
6) Contemporary Sanskrit Works, (7) Maratha Records,
(8) Secondary Works, (9) Magazines and Journals, (10) Maps
and (11) Glossaries. Eight appendices, a good index, a
valuable map of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, and a map of the
battle of Giria, add to the value of this work.

In the first two chapters, the author describes Alivardi's
early career and his rise to power. The dreary narratives
of Maratha invasions and Afghan insurrections form the
topics of the two following chapters. The next (Ch. V)
describes the relations of Alivardi with European traders and
especially with the English, the most powerful of them all.
Then follows (Ch. VI) the story of the closing scene of
Alivardi’s career with an estimate of his character. The

following chapters are of a more general character and they
seek to throw a welcome, if somewhat fitful, light on the
external trade of Bengal, the general economic condition
and the social life of the province. The author's narrative,
based upon a first-hand study of the records and enriched
with his careful observations, is accurate and scholarly, his
style is easy and flowing, his historical reflections are always
thoughtful, his estimate of characters is sound and just. We
have no doubt that the present work will remain for a long
time to come the standard authority on the subject which it
treats.

We would like to offer a few remarks for the considera-
tion of the author in case a second edition of the work is
called for. P. viii, last but one line, for portrait read repro
duction. P. 57, for dominating over read dominate. P.234,

The students of Indian and Indonesian Art and
Archaeology are deeply indebted to Dr. F. M. Schnitger for
the great service he has rendered to scholarship by publish-
ing his work on The Archaeology of Hindoo Sumatra. The
Buddhist and Brahmanical antiquities of Java have been
treated at great length by many writers zmong whom the

names of such veteran scholars as Dr. Kern, Dr.
Stutterheim and Dr. N. J. Krom stand foremost; they as well
as a devoted band of Dutch archaeologists did a great deal
for the elucidation of the past history of Java and the adja-
cent islands of the Indian Archipelago. Dr. Schnitger can well
claim to be ranked as one of them by the painstaking and
methodical researches he has carried in the same line. His
work is of special interest and significance on account of the
fact that he took up Sumatran art and archaeology as his
principal subject and undertook independent exploration and
excavation works in the island. He has thus been able to
collect a vast amount of archaeological materials which throw
a flood of light on its past history and civilisation; the mate-
rials sedulously collected and so ably presented by him in
the work under review fully show what part Eastern and
Southern India played in shaping the art and culture of
‘Sumatra in ancient days.

His work consists of a detailed account of the archaeo-
logical discoveries that were made by himself and by others
in the different parts of southern, central and western
Sumatra. Civilisation in ancient Sumatra as in other countries,
grew along some of the river-valleys. Such are the
Komering, the Musi, the Hari, the Kampar Kanan, the
Barumon and its left tributary the Panei. Among the places
where scientific excavations and explorations were carried
‘on by the scholar himself, mention may be made of the
various sites near Palembang drained by the river Musi,
Muara Djambi and Sungei Langsat on the river Hari, Muara
Takus and various other sites on the Kampar Kanan,
Korintji, Menangkabau and some other places in West
Sumatra, and last, but not the least, the vast and interesting
groups of ruins in the northern part of Central Sumatra—the
Padang Lawas region. The description that he gives of the
various antiquarian remains found in the above localities—
such numerous terracotta objects, stone and bronze
sculptures, architectural fragments and ruins of brick
shrines, and inscriptions—is full and interesting; it will serve

as an incentive to other researches in this field of Indonesian
archaeology in the collection of materials that will enhance
our knowledge of the island's past, The illustrations, though
necessarily limited in number, are yet very much represen-
tative in character and include some very fine stone and
bronze images of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, Siva and
Vignu figures in the same materials, the fine image of the
Bhairava—probably a portrait of king Adityavarman as the
demon Keetrajiia Wigesadharani—from Sangei Langsat, the
ruined brick structures and the very interesting sculptural
and architectural objects found in the Padang Lawas region;
these show the remarkable progress that was made in the
domain of art by the people of Sumatra. On the specimens
of plastic arts which were discovered by him in Padang
Lawas the author remarks, “From the specimens available,
however, one may draw the conclusion that the Hindoo-Batak
sculptors and workers in bronze were as great masters in
their craft as were their colleagues in Java.’ This remark
can be fully endorsed if we look at the fine illustrations
which are incorporated in his book. The bronze figures of
Siva, Vignu, Buddha, Lokesvara and Maitreya in the valley
of the river Musi are not only of exceptional iconographic
interest, but a good many of them also show unmistakable
impress of the Pala school of art in them; a reference to the
Maitreya, Lokegvara and Buddha figures reproduced in Plate
VIII of the volume under review will justify the above
remark. The dancing Heruka of Bahal II in Padang Lawas
(through some inadvertence of the printer the descriptive
labels of this figure and the Kala-makara head reproduced
in ite proper right, in Plate XXXIV have been transposed),
not only from ite iconography, but also from the artistic vigour
manifest in it, is distinctly reminiscent of the best days of the
Eastern school of early medieeval sculpture in India. The dan-
cing figures hybrid in character, that were collected by the
author from Pulo on the Panei in the Padang Lawas region,
were identified by the present reviewer as the Indonesian
counterparts of the Indian ganas in JGIS., Vol. IV, 1937,

ler stock of the wealth of iconographic and artistic material
collected in the pages of this book. It is, however, sufficient
to state that a perusal of its chapters and a careful scrutiny
of the excellent illustrations will enable one to add substan-
tially to his knowledge of Indonesian art and archaeology.

An important announcement is made in the Academie
des Inscriptions et Belles-Letters, Compete Rendus des
Séances de l’Année 1939 Bulletin de Juillet-Aout. From this
we learn that M. Coedés, Director of the French School of the
Far East, has just signed an archeological agreement with
the Siamese Government permitting members of the French
School to excavate in the Siamese territory on the same
terms as those accorded to Siamese archeologists excavat=
ing in French Indo-China. Thus Khmér archeology has
at last acquired the possibility of extending its researches
beyond the political frontier of the French possessions to
the whole territory of Ancient Cambodia.

In August, 1939, a small but select group of paintings
belonging to the collection of Mr. O, C. Gangoly, the well-
known connoisseur and historian of Indian art, was exhibited
in a number of cities in Ceylon at the instance of the Northern
Province Teachers’ Association of the Island. The collec-
tion was a representative one, containing specimens of all
achools of Indian painting from the early Buddhist times
down to the neo-Bengali school of Abanindra Nath Tagore
and Nanda Lal Bose. The exhibition was held at Jaffna
with such success that the Ceylon Soicety of Arte was en-
couraged to invite it to Colombo where it was opened by
Sir Baron D. Jayatilaka, the then Prime Minister of Ceylon
and attended by H. E. the Governor and other notable
visitors. In connection with this last exihibition Dr. Andreas
Nell gave a talk on Indian Art, emphasizing the close connec-
tion of the ancient and medizeval art of Ceylon with that of
India. It is to be hoped that similar exhibitions will be held
in Ceylon in the coming years.

AUGUSTINE M. BOYER

Born at Varenes'on the 20th November, 1850, Boyer was
educated at the Diocesan College at Nantes, at Saint Acheul.
Ordained as priest in 1884, he began to apply himself to
Oriental studies in 1891. His papers on the Indo-Scythian
problem (Nahapana et I'ere Saka, JA., 1897; Sur quelques
inecriptions de I'Inde, Ibid., 1898; L’ Epoque du Kanigka,
Ibid.,1990) attracted wide notice. His epigraphic, paleeogra-
phic and historical studies were crowned by the publication of
an admirable addition of the Niya Texts which he prepared
in collaboration with E. J. Rapson and E. Senart. The
works of Boyer remain as models of scrupulous science
without excluding either elegance of form or boldness of
expression.

RAI KANAK LAL BARUA BAHADUR

Rai K. L. Barua Bahadur, C.I.E., passed away in
Calcutta on the 8th of January 1940, and his death has
removed from our midst a keen and indefatigable research
scholar. He was for many years President of the Kama-
rapa Anusandhan Samiti” (Assam Research Society) and
editor of the Samiti’s Quarterly known as the Journal of
the Assam Research Society. His numerous valuable con:
tributions to this research journal and his monumental histori-
cal work, namely, The Early History of Kamarapa have
brought to light the ancient history of Assam to a remarkable
extent. He was instrumental in the establishment of the
Assam Provincial Museum at Gauhati and was the Govern-
ment-nominated non-official President of this Museum.

The late Rai Bahadur was also an able and experienced
administrator. He was recruited to the Assam Provincial

Service from the Bar and rose to the highest position by
dint of his merit. He was a Deputy Commissioner for years
together and retired as Director of Industries, Assam.
After retirement from Government service he was appointed
a Minister in 1929 and served as such for eight years. Indeed,
Assam has lost in him a very worthy son possessing the
qualifications of an eminent administrator and a profound
scholar.

The Buddhist Monastery of Fondukistan

By J. Hackin
(Concluded from JGIS., Vol. VII, No, 1)

NICHE E

The niche E has happily preserved an important portion
of its outer decoration and in particular the border of the
acroll-pattern in the form of a simple ornamental arcade
encircling the entrance of the niche (Fig. 21). The upper
portion of the arcade, in double bracket, should have
been surmounted by a spouting ribboned vase such as
we have already found at Bamiyan (Caves |], II, V & XI)
and to which we have alluded while considering the
niche C of the sanctuary of Fondukistan. The  scroll-
Pi ns forming the frame (Fig. 22) offer this peculiarity of
having the extremities slightly dented; a detail which we
have already noted while studying the decoration of
certain caves of Bamiyan situated near the statue of the
Buddha of 53 metres (Caves I, II, V & XI) (see Fig. 23). As
at Bamiyan the leaf-shaped ornaments are poor enough ; the
volutes, however, are treated with greater ease. The
scroll-patterns are surmounted by a thin line of flying birds
(parrots). The horizontal portion of the scroll-patterns is
supported by a pilaster of squat shaft surmounted by

Google y H
86 J. HACKIN

a peudo-Corinthian capital (Fig. 21), whose ornamentation
could be compared with those of the capitals supporting
the simple arcades of the caves already mentioned at
Bamiyan (Fig. 24). At Fondukistan the base of the pilaster
rests upon a basement which simulates ona small scale
‘a construction composed of several courses disposed in
festoon-like omaments. Between. the pilaster and the
entrance of the niche appear two mural paintings, a
Bodhisattva on the left of the statue at the base (Fig. 25)
and’a Buddha on the right. The Bodhisattva of a ‘clear
complexion and seated in the posture of royal relaxation
is figured: ageinst an aureole of vivid red; the head slightly
bent towards the right is framed by a green nimbus of
water encompassed with white ; the right hand raised to
the height of the shoulder holds a blue lotus (ufpala) ; the
middle and little fingers of the left hand hold the neck of
fa vase adorned with cabochons and provided with a spout.
The lower part of the body is draped in a striped dhoti.
The torsé is nude. The oraments partly resemble those
which we have had occasion to describe (deoatas of niche
D). Nevertheless the ornaments which encircle the cabo-
chons of the bracelet-armlets and of the central motif of the
diadem are not joined together ; they are independent of
fone another. The ear-pendants which are circular are of
large dimensions. A chain formed of circles of beautiful
eyes goes upon the left shoulder and glides from the right
shoulder upon the forearms. The blue lotuses appear in
the hair; a white ribbon stretches out on the left of the
head of the Bodhisattva ; the tracing of the nose appears
to be simplified in the extreme (a small hook). The eyes
with prominent pupils are surrounded with black. The
group is specially remarkable for the boldness of contrasted
styles; the contours are traced with a very marked sharp-
ness and insistence; the left arm which should have rested
on the knee is treated with a certain clumsin« 8 well
bent but it rests without support. This image continues,
inspite of its clumsiness and an extreme mannerism, the

charm and grace of Indian models of the sixth century
(Magadha), and it could be compared with certain Tibetan
paintings specially of a White Tara. The sources of Indian

spiration of these Tibetan images may obviously be
assigned to the same epoch as the paintings of Fondukistan
(7th century A.C.). The painting which is found on the
other side of the entrance of the niche depicts a Buddha
seated under the Bodhi tree; the subject is very much
damaged.

The excavation of niche E led to the discovery of two
statues placed against the same base of the niche; we
have here two figures, a man anda woman (Fig. 26) sepa-
rated by a pile of four cushions upon which they are lean-
ing. The heads have disappeared ; the right down-turned
leg of the mule is in the vertical position, while the left
leg reste horizontally in a flat position; the torso remains
erect in such a way that the figure, for avoiding the fatigue
which such a posture could not fail to cause, has to rest a
portion of the weight of the torso upon his elbow sustained
by the pile of cushions. This posture is that which was
affected by certain kings of the Sassanide dynasty; a piece
of goldsmith’s work furnishes us with a characteristic illus-
tration of an analogous scene exhibiting likewise a pile of
cushions (balis), six for the king, two only for the queen’;
but here the king is turned towards the queen who is found

on his right (Fig. 27). The king wears boots, which is also
the case with Fondukistan. The vestment is a long and
well-adjusted tunic opened at the chest and provided with
a large tight collar. This tunic was ornamented with
circular medallions fringed with a row of large pearls. Inside
the medallions are inscribed scarcely visible motifs of
birds and human mascarons(?). The whole of this deco-
ration accords with the distinctly Iranian costume. A waist-
band made of cabochons encircled with pearls covers the
figure with particular tightness. The torso which widens
itself appears extremely stretched out. The trousers are
slightly folded. The tunic worn by the princely figure of
Fondukistan resembles, through the style of vestment of
the kneeling personage, the bearer of a plate of offerings
represented at the end of the left lateral wall which
sheltered the Buddha of 53 metres.’* This vestment
clearly differs from the tunics with which are clothed the
figures of the donors disposed upon the left lateral wall and
upon the right and left of the niche of the Buddha of 35
metres. In this last case the donors wear tunics with a
single facing or tunics without facing, upon which could be
seen the sort of shoulder-belts of which the straps are fixed
in the middle of a girdle placed over the body.* A similar
apparatus was current at the epoch of Shapir II (309-379
A.C.) and of Shap III'* (383-388 A.C.), that is, anterior to the
representations at Fondukistan and at the niche of the great
Buddha at Bamiyan. The female figure with harmonious
forms, thin waist, round shoulders, opulent chest, is clearly
Indian in aspect; the examination of the ornaments enforces

this first impression. These are the necklaces of pearls
to which is joined a long chain of pearls to which again
were fixed on the outer side the circular cabochons sur-
rounded with pearls. The bracelets, double at the wrist,
are composed of pearls. A light scarf covers the shoul-
ders. The lower part of the body is draped in a dhoti.
The torso appears to be nude. We do not notice at
the armpit the light folds which appear on the two
busts which we shall have occasion to describe. Under
the figure of the princely personage was found a funerary
urn (Fig. 28) containing besides the ashes two drachmae
with the effigy of the Sassanide king Chosroés Parwez
(590-627 A. C.), a small unidentified coin and several
bronze coins of a Sar of Gharjistan’’ (Fig. 29). Another
funerary urn enveloped in a white silk stuff without
ornaments, was concealed in the turning of the wall
(lateral right wall of the niche) (Fig. 28). The paintings
which adorned the base of the niche had suffered much.
Two female figures, one with a clear complexion, the other
with a dark skin, appeared to come out of the background
ona seed-bed of four leaves. The circular ear-pendants
appeared large. The white female wears a striped dhoti
(Fig. 30). Both figures have the nude torso. The breasts
are particularly developed. The style is clearly Indian.
Fixed from one part to another against the lateral right
and left walls appeared the female busts as coming out
above a drapery (Fig. 31). The original blue and red

tween the surface of the wall and the bust treated in high
relief does not representa new element for us; we have
already observed it at Bamiyan (Group of CavesC); but
at Bamiyan only the trace of the bust survives, the drapery
being still visible (Fig. 32). It is evident that the momen-
tary and apparitional character of these figures is opposed to
the static and congealed character of the princely couple;
this drapery #0 much reduced should apparently be derived
from the thick draperies representing veritable clotures
which appear on certain Graeco-Buddhist _ bas-reliefs,
specially upon a frieze of Buddhas and their assistants found
at Sikri and published by M. A. Foucher."* At Sikri the
figures appear behind the drapery and partly concealed by
this drapery. At Fondukistan the drapery is treated like a
veritable support.

NICHE K

The niche K originally formed one of the corridors of
access to the sanctuary; in walling up the corridor a niche
had been constructed which was not very deep. Some
fragments of statues and vestiges of mural paintings were
there brought to light. On the lateral right wall were found
some particularly interesting figures of the lunar and solar
divinities (Fig. 33). The lunar deity with haggard face
appeared on the left; he wears a diadem with three crescents
such as we have observed at Bamiyan. The nimbus is
emphasised by a crescent. The circular ear-pendants are
ornamented with pearls. The black and long hair rests
upon the shoulders. The long tunic with double facing is
tightly attached to the body by a black belt ornamented

with cabochons lined with white; the scabbard of the long
straight sword is also ornamented with medallions. A
small round buckler is attached to the left arm. We must
finally mention the gaiters of tiger-skin(?) adorned with
a border of oval ornaments. The moustached solar deity
has a nimbus of red disc ; the upper part of the face has
isappeared. He wears an armour protecting the torso;
this portion of the armour is composed of metal-plaques
in the form of lozenges; the lower part is formed of a
veritable fabric of metallic scales protecting the abdomen;
the lower vestment terminating like’ a round apron is visible
and covers the trousers; The boots are black: The straight
sword has a richly adorned scabbard. A ‘sort ‘of knob-
stick is held by the left arm. The two figures’ are already
very Central Asian and it is interesting to recall the
lunar deity with the haggard face who was found at the
summit of the niche of the Buddha of 35 metres at Bamiyan.
Among the fragments of statuettes brought to light in
clearing the niche K, we must mention very specially a
head of marked originality (Fig. 34).

By BaTakRISHNA GHOSH

Sanskrit has long been regarded as the oldest Indo-
European language, but now the pride of place must go
to Hittite which Sommer has declared to be an “‘Indo-
European language in its flexional structure."” The Indo-
European character of this language is not at all so obvious
in other respects, and Sturtevant has actually suggested that
Hittite should rather be regarded as a cognate to the
original Indo-European and not to the Indo-European
dialects collectively or severally. But it is precisely the
grammatical structure which decides the affiliation of any
perticular language, for both phonology and vocabulary are
to such a degree susceptible to extraneous influence that
they may change beyond recognition within a comparatively
short time, and syntax being concerned more with universal
ideas than with particular forms can hardly serve as a
criterion in this respect. Yet the evidence of phonology,
vocabulary and syntax cannot be summorily dismissed as
valueless if they all point in the same direction, particularly
in the direction suggested by the flexional structure, as
in the case of Hittite. .

Hittite history will perhaps never be fully reconstructed,
but it is definitely established to-day that for many centuries
the Hittites held a mighty empire in Western Asia, and
under Mur8ili8 I these hardy Cappadocian mountaineers
actually conquered Babylonia about the middle of the 18th
century B. C., thus putting an end to the dynasty of

Hammurapi. The most important events of the later
Hittite empire are the battle of Kade’ between king
Muwatallis and Ramses Il of Egypt (1305 B.C.), and
Hattu8il’s treaty with the same Pharaoh in the twenty-first
year of the latter’s reign (1289 B.C.). The great Hittite
emperor Suppiluliuma’ was a contemporary of Pharaoh
Amenophis Ill (c. 1419-1384) and outlived also his successor
(c. 1384-68).

In the earliest period the Hittites seem to have been
divided into a number of city-states, the most important
of them being Zalpa, Nea and KuSar—each of which
attained supremacy one after another and was undoubtedly
influenced by the incredibly early Assyrian commercial
settlements in Cappadocia. At the next stage the hege-
mony seems to have passed permanently to the kingdom
of Hatti: the third Hatti ruler Mur8ili8 I actually conquered
Babylon but could not retain it for a long time. This
sudden expansion seems however to have been detrimental
to the Hittite empire, for there followed a long period of
anarchy which was put an end to by the wise ruler Telepinu’
about 1650B.C. The history of the older Hittite empire
ends abruptly at this point. After almost a complete blank
of two centuries the Hittites again emerge on the stage of
history—this time to fight against Mitanni, the most power-
ful State founded by the Hurrians in northern Mesopotamia.
The great age of Hittite history was reached under the
rule of Suppiluliuma’ (1395-55 B.C.) who made the con-
quered Mitanni-kingdom a buffer state against the rising
power of AfSur. But danger came from the quarter
whence it was least expected: it came from the country of
Ahhijawa on the western fringe of the Peninsula, and
from Arzawa in the south. There was a mighty coalition
of Ahhijawa, Arzawa and other countries of Asia Minor
against the Hittite king Arnuwanda8 (C. 1230-15). This was
the beginning of the end to all appearance. The state
which even after Suppiluliuma’ was undoubtedly the
greatest power in western Asia for more than a century,

thus came to an abrupt and inglorious end, and so com-
pletely disappeared from history that practically nothing
was known about its people until quite in recent times
modern archaeologists and philologists made them directly
speak to us.

The language, though not its name, was dis-
covered by Knudzon in 1902 from two letters excavated
at Tell-el-Amarna. These are usually called the Arzawa-
letters, because one of them is from Amenophis Ill of
Egypt to Tarhundaraba, the king of Arzawa. The scanty
material of these two letters was enough to convince
Knudzon that the language in which they were composed
was Indo-European. It was possible to decipher these
letters only because they are full of Sumero-Akkadian ideo-
grammes which left little doubt as to the general tenor
of their contents. Abundant material for systematic study
of the language was however soon available when
Winckler after his epoch-making excavations at Boghaz-
kéi unearthed the State-archives of the Hittite emperors.
Yet little progress was made in Hittite studies, for Winckler
fell ill and died (1913), and after his death the Bo; ki
records were relegated to Assyriologists in consideration of
the cuneiform script in which they are written. But the
Assyriologists could not make much headway even though
they could easily read the records and had at their disposal
fragments of Akkado-Hittite bilingual texts. Yet, after all,
it was the Assyriologist Hrozny who in 1914 for the first
time fully deciphered some Hittite texts, and even the
warring world was startled by his announcement that the
language deciphered by him is Indo-European. Since
then Hittite studies have progressed by leaps and bounds.

It has been said above that Assyriologists could easily
read the Hittite texts written in cuneiform script. This state-
mentis to be taken literally, for even now there are differences
of opinion as to how particular signs should be read. The
Hittites had adopted the Akkadian cuneiform system for
writing their language, but that

of syllabic signss The sounds constituting syllables
not been isolated by the Akkadians, so that the Hittites
1g their script had to take recourse to various make-
ifte when any combination of the syllabic signs at their
disposal could not give an accurate picture of the sounds
they wished to express. And the Akkadian syllabic 8
were such that many common sounds or sound-combina-
tions could not be expressed by them, although the Hittites
used no less than one hundred and ty-seven such signs.
On the other hand, many words could be, and used to be,
written in various ways by means of these borrowed syllabic
signs.

First and foremost, it is impossible to express
double-consonance, or tri-consonance, by means of the Ak-
kadian syllabary used by the Hittites—for the simple reason
that no sign of this syllabary begins or ends with double
consonance. This serious flaw in the system had however
no significance for Sumero-Akkadian, which had no con-
sonant-groups at the beginning or end of a word and no
groups of more than two consonants in the interior of a
word. But that was not at all the case with Hittite. Un-
etymological and unpronounced vowels had therefore to
be frequently introduced by the Hittites into the graphic
forms of words of their language. Thus the prefix pra
(<I. E, *pro) could not be expressed in Hittite writing be-
cause it begins with the consonant-group pr. The graphic
form of Hittite pra is in fact pa-ra-a (three signs). Mute
vowels had to be introduced into written forms also when
words ended with consonant-groups (e.g. e-el-ta for ést) or
contained groups of three consonants (e.g. li-in-ik-ta for
linkt). It is clear that no homogeneous system of spelling
could be maintained in this state of things. Thus the word
tametaz, for example, could be written ta-me-ta-az, tam-e-
ta-az, ta-me-it-az, etc. The first problem confronting the
student of Hittite is therefore to determine the non-
phonetic pleonastic vowels present in the graphic form
‘of almost every word. Moreover, the Hittites were

ial or final

Google
96 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

averse to beginning a word only with a vowel-sign or a
syllabic sign beginning with a vowel. In writing words
beginning with a vowel, it was their custom to use both
the vowel-sign and a syllabic sign beginning with the same
vowel; thus a-ak-te-ni=akteni,u-un-na-i=unai. It will be
clear from this that even though the script was known
it was by means an job to determine the phonetic
values of particular written forms.

Hittite borrowings from the Akkadians were not confined
merely to the syllabic symbols discussed above. Akka-
dian words were freely used by the Hittites as ideogrammes,
and that for some of the commonest words of their lan-
guage. We do not even know the Hittite word for ‘king’,
for it is always represented ideographically by Sumero-
Akkadian LUGAL. For the same reason, the Hittite words
for ‘god’ and ‘son’ are yet unknown, for the ‘ites used
in their documents only the Akkadian graphic forms of
these words, which they however doubtless read not as the
Akkadians themselves would read them, but according
to the sound-values of the corresponding Hittite words.
But the Akkadians themselves used Sumerian word-symbols
ideographically in their language. Thus sometimes we find
beside the phonetically-written Hittite word also the corres-
ponding Sumerian and Akkadian forms—as, for instance,
Hit. ki-ei-Sar, Sumerian SU and Akkadian QA.TU, all
pronounced kesar and meaning “‘hand’’.* In writing their
own language the Akkadians often added Akkadian phone-
tic endings to Sumerian ideogrammes, and this too was
faithfully copied by the Hittites, to whom however not only
the Sumerian part but the whole of the word (Sum. ideo-
gramme+Akk. phonetic ending) was an ideogramme.
Thus beside the above-mentioned forms SU and
QA.TU. a Sumero-Akkadian mixed form like SU.TU was

* In the system of transcription now universally accepted, the
Sumerian ideogrammes are represented by erect capitals and the
Akkadian ones by slanting capitals,

HITTITE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE 7

also possible in Hittite writing. The Sumerians
employed in their writing also a number of determinatives,
usually prefixed, which however were never pronounced,
their function being merely to modify the meaning of the
word governed by it in a particular way. Thus the sign
SAL ‘woman’ may be prefixed to the designation of a
woman's occupation. Along with the Sumerian ideo-
grammes the Hittites borrowed from the Akkadians also
these non-phonetic Sumerian determinatives. Thus the
determinative UZU, meaning ‘part of the body’, may be
prefixed to SU ‘hand’. In transcribed Hittite texte these
determinatives are written with raised capital letters, e.g.,
""$U, the whole complex, read as kesar by Hittites them-
selves, meaning “the hand which f the body".

This is the system of older Hittite writing which, apart
from the Sumero-Akkadian ideogrammes without any
Phonetic Hittite equivalents, can be read, though in many
cases we are far from certain as to how they actually used
to be read by the Hittites. For it is not always safe to
assume for Hittite the same phonetic value which the
syllabic signs enjoyed in the parent Akkadian language.
‘Thus the Akkadian sign for z (sonant dental sibilant) was
used by the Hittites to represent the fricative ts, and
Akkadian § in their language assumed the value of s. The
value of Akkadian h in Hittite is still a matter of dispute.
The exact timbre of Akkadian vowels in Hittite will perhaps
never be determined, and for their quantity too it is any-
thing but certain that they were long in all those cases
where they are written double; cf., e.g. e-ei-zi=Skt. as-ti
X<I-E. *es-tii— Later Hittites, from about 800 B. C.
began to use a system of hieroglyphs for writing th
language. The clue to this “hieroglyphic Hittite’? has not
yet been found.

In the field of vocalism Hittite ranges itself definitely on
the side of the western Indo-European languages, for
unlike Indo-Iranian it retains the vowel e distinct from a;
cf. Hit, esmi, Gr. eimnt, Lith. esmt: Skt. ds-mis Hit. et “to

eat” : Skt. ad; Hit. seszi: Skt. sasti “sleeps”; Hit. nepii,
Lat. nebu(la): Skt. nébhas; Hit. wek-: Skt. vaé- (cf. Gr.
hekén) ; Hit. eshar, Gr. éar:Skt. asrk; Hit. mekis, Gr.
mégas: Skt. mah- etc. On account of the imperfect
system of writing it is not possible to determine whether
1.-E. é had retained its length in Hittite; both the roots *es-
(Skt. as-) and *és- (Skt: ds-), for instance, are written in the
same way in Hittite.—I.-E. a remains unchanged in Hittite.
Cf. Hit. apa: Skt. apa, Gr. apé ; Hit. harkis ‘white,’ Skt.
arjuna, Gr. argés, etc. As the written forms afford no clue
as to the length of the vowels, it is impossible to say
whether I.-E. a retained its length in Hittite. Its quality
at all events remained unchanged. Cf. Hit. stapi: Skt.
sthapayati; Hit. tayezi ‘steal Skt. tayu, etc.—The third
normal vowel e becomes a in Hittite, which in this respect
may therefore be said to side with Indo-Iranian: Hit.
hastai: Skt. asthi but Gr. ostéon ; Hit. pra, Skt. pra, but
Gr. pré, ete. I-E. long appears as a in Hittite, which
may be read long, e.g. Hit. laman (with dissimilation)
‘name’: Lat némen. Both the extreme vowels i and u
remain unchanged in Hittite. The Skt. primary personal
+ti and -nti have their exact counterpat
-mi, -zi and -nzi; the Indo-Iranian imperative
endings -tu and -ntu have outside parallels only in Hit.; cf.
further Hit. yukan: Skt. yugam, Hit. kenu: Skt. janu, Hit.
nu: Skt. nu, ete.

In dealing with the descendants of the easily contrac-
tible I.-E. diphthongs in the various dialects we have to be
doubly cautious. For when comparing a dialectical form
with the corresponding basic I.-E. form, it is not at all safe
to equate straightway an I.-E. diphthong contained in the
latter with whatever may seem to occupy ite place in
the former, for the two sounds may be of different ablaut-
grades. It is assumed, for want of anything better, that if
the forms compared are of the same grammatical category,
then also the roots contained in them will be of the same
ablaut-grade. This is no doubt probable, but still far from

Google
HITTITE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE 9

certain. We can be tolerably certain only where we have
the additional testimony of accent. But of Hittite accent
we know nothing. The following treatment of I.-E. diph-
thongs in Hittite should therefore be regarded as tentative.
Hit. lukzi, for instance, certainly corresponds to Skt. rocate.
But it cannot be safely assumed on the basis of this and
similar etymologies that Hittite u corresponds to Skt. o
(<I.-E. eu), for the Hittite word may contain the reduced-
grade form of the root which appears in its normal grade in
the Skt. word.

All short i-diphthongs become e (often written i) in
Hittite as in Skt. Thus the I.-E. medial ending -tai (=Gr.
stai) in third person gular appears ste in
Hittite. It is true that this ending often appears also as
-ti, but this must be an  orthographical makeshift
of which we have seen so much above, for I.-E.
ti phonologically becomes tsi (written zi) in Hittite.
Examples like Hit. kemanz (written gi-im-ma-an-za)
‘winter’ corresponding to Skt. hemanta, Gr. kheima and
Hit. keta ‘lies’ corresponding to Skt. gete, Gk. keitai conclu-
sively prove the transformation of I.-E. ei into ¢ in tite.
The same change for I.-E. oi is proved by the Hittite
pronominal exclitics me, te, corresponding to Skt. me, te
and Gr. mot tof.—Short u-diphthongs on the other hand
become u in Hittite, but it is not impossible that this u was
an open sound approaching 0; cf. Hit. lukzi: Skt, rocate,
Gr. leukés; Hit. arnuzi: Skt. rnéti. Comparison of gram-
matical forms of similiar categories seems to suggest that
1.-E. long i-diphthongs have become ai and I.-E. long u
diphthongs have become au in Hittite. This is the general
position also of Skt.

The semi-vowels on the whole are well-preserved in
Hittite. Thus % in yukan: Skt. yugam, yatari: Skt. yati,
etc. (Intervocalic % however is often lost as also in many
other I.-E. dialects.) The same is the case with I.-E. wv, cf.
Hit. watar: Eng. water; Hit. wasi ‘buys’: Skt. vas-nayati;
Hit. weti: Skt. vat-sara, Lat. vetus; Hit, wekzi:Skt. vagti.

Google
100 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

Not only I.-E. r but also r seems to be preserved in Hittite,
though the graphic forms are always misleading. Variant
orthographic forms of the same word however often clearly
indicate the syllabic character of the r in question. Thus
the three variant forms pa-ap~ i, Pa-ap-ra-as-zi and
Pa-ap-par-as-zi can but be imperfect representations of
paprszi. In the same way, Hit. parkui and Arta3iumara
seem to correspond to Skt. bhrgu and Rtasmara respective-
ly. But it is important to remember in this connection that
the syllabic r, not only in Hittite, but in other I.-E. dialects
as well, might have been preceded or followed, or both,
by a feeble vowel. On the analogy of syllabic r, a syllabic
1 too is assumed to have existed in Hittite, but the evidence
for it is far from satisfactory.—Ablaut-relations between
congeneric Hittite forms being largely blurred through
defective writing, it is hardly possible to draw a definite
conclusion as to the existence or otherwise of syllybic nasals
in Hittite. Yet I.-E. m seems to have become ain Hit. (as
in Skt.), for Skt. tamas- is met there by tas- <tms-. 1.-E.
non the other hand developed into an; thus Hit. anzas
is": 1-E, *ns: Skt. nas; the Hit. medial ending -anta
in third person plural corresponds to Skt. -ate <*I-E.

Hittite throws welcome light on the vexed problem of
Indo-European gutturals. It is usually assumed that the
original I.-E. possessed three series of gutturals (see my
Ling Introduction to Sanskrit, p- 9), but the claim of
pure velars to be considered as an independent series of
gutturals rests on a very slender basis indeed. The chief
problem for us in this regard is to decide whether the
original I.-E. possessed a series of labio-velars distinct
from the palatals, i.e., whether the earliest Indo-Europeans
could and did pronounce a labio-velar immediately before
@ palatal vowel and a palatal immediately before a guttural
vowel. Present-day speakers of I.-E. dialects cannot pro-
nounce such sound-combinations. Would it then be proper
to ascribe such hypothetical sound-combinations to the

Google
HITTITE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE 101

original Indo-European? Would it not be more advisable
to assume that although already in the pre-Indo-European
epoch the gutturals were split up into labio-velars and pala-
tals, the former were yet invariably followed by guttural
vowels and the latter invariably by palatal ones, and that
only at the later Indo-European stage, through analogical
transfer perhaps, ps | vowels began to take position also
after labio-velars and guttural vowels after palatals? This
is what is suggested by the Hittite gutturals. In Hittite, kw
represents I.-E, kw, and there is nothing to show that the
w of this combination was not a full-fledged semi-vowel,
which as usual, often changed into u. Thus Hit. ku-id: Lat.
quis <I.-E.*k"is; Hit. ku-na-an-zi (kunanzi):Skt. ghnanti
<I.-E.*g"hnenti. Akkadian signs for ku, kur always stand
for fully independent syllables, and ii highly improbable
that Hi scribes in giving the graphic form of the descen-
dant of I.-E. k” in their language would have used those
signs if the sound in question was really different from kw.
If the sound k” was actually present in Hittite we should
rather expect ku-wa-na-an-zi instead of ku-na-an-2i as the
graphic form of the Hittite representative of. I.-E. *g™hnenti.
This is however never found. It is therefore permissible
to assume with Sturtevant (§ 54a) that the labio-velars as
such were a later develo pment of the Indo-European state,
because their existence as separate independent sounds
before the parent Indo-European language separated from
the basic Indo-Hittite is yet to be proved.

The above and other examples show that Hit. kw (ku
before consonants) corresponds to 1.-E. k”. But the
Hittite sound corresponding to I.-E. g” is w, . gu being
met by ku in Hit.; cf. Hit. wem-: Skt. gam- (g"em-), but
Hit. Rutar ‘neck’: Lat. guttur ‘throat’ (| gut-). Hit. w
and ku correspond to I.-E. g"h. Thus Hit. war- ‘to burn’:
Skt. har- (Gr. ther-més)<L.-E. *g"her-, but Hit. kwen: Skt.
han- <I.-E.* g*hen-.

L-E. palatal occlusives had not been spirantised in
Hittite as in the Sat@m-languages and in this respect too
3

Google
102 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

Hittite is to be ranged with the western dialects.
Thus Hit. keta, Gr. keitai: Skt. sete; Hit. wekzi: Skt.
vasti (<vas-ti); Hit. kartis: Lith. szirdis (connected with
Skt. hrd-). A non-palatal pure velar is to be found in
Hit. lukate: Skt. rocate (cf. Gr. leu! The I.-E inchoa-
tive suffix -skh- appears as -sk- Hittite, as is proved by
the examples Hit. arskezi: Skt. rcchati, and uskezi:
Skt. ucchati. I.-E. 9 appears as k in Hit. Thus Hit. kenu:
Avestan nu, Skt. janu; Hit. yukan: Skt. yugam; Hit.
hark-is: Skt. arj-una, etc. I.-E. gh too is represented by
the same k, as in Hit. kemanz: Skt. hemanta, Gr. kheima;
Hit. parkus: Skt. brhant-, Avestan b®r?zant; Hit. talukaes:
Skt. dirgha, Gr. dolikh«

As for the dentals, I.-E. ¢ is retained in Hittite excepting
before tal vowels where it becomes ts (written 2); thus
L-E. *es-enti, Skt. santi: Hit. asanzi. This change was
carried on further in non-Doric Greek dialects which chang-
ed [.-E. ti into si. 1.-E. d was hardened into t in Hittite.
Thus I.-E. *ed- “to eat’: Hit. et-; Hit. tek-: Skt. dié-; Hit.
tara: Skt. dara; Hit. watar: Gr. hiidér. I.-E. dh too appears
as tin Hit., e.g. Hit. it: Skt. ihé, Gr. éthi; Hit. utne: Skt.
ddhar, Gr. oiithar, etc.—Various sounds have developed
in the I.-E. dialects as the result of the collision of dentals.
I-E. -tt- is retained in Skt., but in Greek it normally
becomes -st- and in Lat. -ss-. Before the Hittite language
was discovered it was therefore necessary to assume that
1-E. tt had at first given rise to ft. Hittite proves that
this assumption was correct. Thus I.-E. *et-ti (K*ed-ti):
Hit. ezzi, which is but a defective writing for ets-tsi.

Hittite not having at its disposal any mesns of indicat-
ing the sound 6, and all aspirated sounds being apparently
de-aspirated in Hittite, there is but the sole sound p in
ite to represent the whole I.-E. labial series. As for
-E. p, we may consider Hit. pasi (<"patsi
<“pati): Skt. pati ‘drinks’; Hit. stapi: Skt. sthapayati,
etc. Examples of Hit. p= bh are also quite unambi-
guous : Hit. nepis: Skt. nabhas, Hit. krap-: Skt. grabh- etc.

Google

HITTITE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE 103,

It will be clear from above that in writing at least the
Hittites made no distinction between t and d, kand g,
p and b. But does it justify the assumption that instead
of four occlusives in each series the Hittites had only one?
The facts however are not so simple. It is true that ta
and da, ka and ga are practically interchangeable in
Hittite writing. But we have also to note that the Hit
wrote almost exclusively ti and ki, and very rarely di and
gi. The imperative ending on the other hand is mostly
written du and rarely tu. It would therefore be hazardous
to declare that the Hittites, like the speakers of many non-
Indo-European languages, had only one dental, one pala-
tal, etc. It is not impossible that what to us appears as
the simplification of 1.-E. system of occlusives wi fact
nothing but an uncompleted sound-shift.—Hittite h is a
problem by itself. Examples like Hit. harkis: Gr. argés,
Hit. hastai: Skt. dethi, Hit. hwekzi: Skt. vdkti, etc. seem
to suggest that in some cases at least the Hit. h is unety-
mological. In the written forms of these and other words
the Hittite h seems to indicate a strong expiratory accent
and nothing more. In modern German, for instance, which
is characterised by a very pronounced expiratory accent, an
unetymological h is distinctly heard at the beginning of
many words commencing with a vowel.

In the field of nominal flexion we have to note first of
all that Hittite has completely given up the feminine gender
and retains only faint traces of the dual number. It is
perhaps unwise to say that the Hittite dropped the feminine
gender, for we do not know whether the feminine gender
had been developed in the basic language before Hittite
separated from it. It is generally admitted—and that on good
grounds—that the feminine gender was a later development
in the original Indo-European. Because the feminine
gender primarily conveys a negative idea and thus must
have been developed later than its positive counterpart.
When we say “man” we include in our idea not only men
but women ‘man is mortal’, But if we say

Google
104 BATAKRISHNA GHOSH

instead “woman is mortal’’, it might indirectly suggest that
men are immortal! From the veiw-point of linguistic
psychology therefore the feminine gender is a purely nega-
tive idea, for its function consists in specifying for a parti-
cular group its non-identity with a larger species, and the
degree of specification thus achieved need not have been
enough to make an independent grammatical category of
this specified group.—It is otherwise with the dual number.
The very existence of a grammatical dual number shows
that the early Indo-Europeans could not abstract the univer-
sal out of particulars so long as the number of such pari-
culars was confined to two. But they were able to abstract
the universal if there were three particulars present—after
which specification was no longer necessary. That is
why the plural number begins with three in I.-E. languages.
It 0 natural to expect that the more primitive an 1.-E.
tribe, the greater will be its need for the dual number. The
Hittites as the oldest known I.-E. tribe therefore may be
expected to have retained it. But they have not. Like
most other I.-E. languages, Hittite too, with a few doubtful
exceptions (Sturtevant § 184), has done away with the
grammatical dual number.

se-system Hittite is not so conservative as Skt.
Excluding vocative, which in Hittite has coincided with
nominative, Hittite shows six distinct cases, namely, nomi-
native, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative and geni-
tive. Formantically the Hittite instrumental developed
out of original ablative and it is no wonder therefore that in
Hittite syntax ablative and instrumental are often inter-
changeable. A similar syncretism is to be observed also
with regard to original dative id locative: in Hittite
the original lacative, though retaining its own ending, has
been functionally completely merged in the dative—The
nominative singular of every masculine stem ends in 8, e-g.1
ata-s, aupi-a, etc., and the corresponding ending in accusa-
tive isn<m. Neuter a-stems take the ending n<m in nom.-

gen. sing normally ends in -as whatever the stem final
may be" (Sturtevant). Thus from tuzis and asus the forms
in gen. 8g. are tuziyas and asuwas respectively. These are
evidently forms of the flexion forte, lingering traces of
which may be found in the oldest Skt. (see my Linguistic
Introduction to Skt., p. 132). The dative sg. of a-stems
usually ends in e: formantically the forms in question are
nothing but locatives. The ablative sing. ends in -z, which
is perhaps the nil-grade form of the 1.-E. ablative
fix -tos. In instr. sg. Hittite a-stems end in this
to be directly connected with the I.-E. abl. ending -ed
(cf. Skt. pase-at, Lat. faciluméd). The ending in nom.
pl. masc. is -es, and thus in complete agreement with
Sanskrit; but the acc. pl. masc. ends in -us.—Indo-
European dialects are sometimes divided into two groups
according as the dual and plural endings in instr., dat.
and abl. begin with bh or m (see my Linguistic Introduction
to Skt, p. 16). Hittite however shows no trace of these
consonantal endings, which therefore should have been of
later origin. —In Hit. pronominal flexion, as in that of
other I.E. languages, there is a standing interplay of

ithin the same paradigm, and personal
endinge are almost wholly wanting.

The I.-E. verbal system has been greatly simplified in
Besides the active voice, the medio-passive has
still been retained in it, but of the rich I.-E. temporal and
modal system nothing has been left but a present and a
preterite in the indicative, and an imperative. Future is
expressed by present forms. Of secondary conjugations
we have two in Hittite, namely, causative and iterative.
There is also a periphrastic perfect, formed with the
ry verb har(k)- “to have.’ On the other hand,
ittite shows some striking innovations in the verbal system.

Of these endings -mi, -si, -zi and -nzi are quite trans-
parent and need no explanation. But the ending -hi in the
first person sing. offers a seemingly insoluble problem (see
Sturtevant § 401). According as the first person singular
takes the ending -mi or -hi, the Hittite verbal stems are
divided into mi-conjugation and hi-conjugation respec-
tively. Of the endings -weni, -meni, the latter is probably
an analogical modification of the I.-E. plural ending -mes
after -teni, which is to be connected with Vedic -thana.
Corresponding to -weni and -teni we have the preterital
endings -wen and -ten. Linguistically the most important
preterital ending is -er of the third person pl. of the hi-con-

cf. Skt. dad-ur, Lat. amav-ere, tokh. weiia: In im-
perative the endings -u (3. sg.) and -ndu (3. pl.) are as-
tonishing, for they prove that the deictic particle u had been
permanently joined to the original injunctive forms long
before the Indo-Iranian era (see LIS., pp. 39-40). The
medio-passive r-endings, such rari (3. sg.) and -ntari
(3. pl.) of the present, have their exact counterparts in
Italo-Celtic and Tokharian; cf. Lat. legi-tur, leg-untur.—
Of 1.-E. verbal suffixes, -skh and -nu are well attested in
‘ite. Hittite participles in -nt (-anz) are clearly re-
miniscent of Indo-European participles.

A Rare Indian Temple-type in Cambodia*
By U. N. GHosHaL

It is a well-known fact that classifications of types of
temples (prasddas) or of buildings in general (vimanas) form
a conspicuous feature of the Indian treatises on Fine Arts
(Silpasastras). The schemes of classification in these works
are not uniform, but are very various, depending as they do
upon different principles of grouping. There is, first, the
broad division into nagara, dravida and vesara, which may
roughly be rendered as ‘North Indian’, ‘Deccan’ and ‘Southern’
styles. This division is found not only in Manasara, the
standard work on Hindu architecture, but also in such com-
pilations as the Suprabhedagama, as is shown by reference
to the valuable Dictionary of Hindu Architecture, by P. K.
Acharya (s.v. prasdda). The primarily geographical chi
ter of this classification is well brought out in a few verses
of the recently published work, the Silparatna (Trivandrum
Sanskrit Series, No. LXXV) to which sufficient attention
does not appear to have been given so far. The verses
(Parvabhaga Ch. XVI, vv. 47-49) are as follows :—

Himavad= Vindhyayor=madhyam sattvikam bhitalam

smrtam |
Vindhyasailadi-Krsnantam rajasam parikirttitam ||
Punah Krgnadi-Kanyantam tamasam bhatalam bhavet |
Nagaram sattvike dese rajase dravidam bhavet ||
Vesaram tamase dese kramena parikirttitah |

This may be freely rendered as follows: ‘The tract
between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas is one of good-
ness, that between the Vindhyas and the Krsna is one of
passion, while the country between the Krsna and Cape

Comorin is one of darkness. The nagara style is said to
prevail in the country of goodness, the dravida style in the
country of passion, and the vesara style in the country of
darkness.”

Another important classification which the Silparatna
(p. 182) shares with the Mana is into twelve groups
ranging from buildings of one storey to those of twelve
storeys. Each of these is again divided into a number of
sub-groups making the huge total of ninety-eight types.
(P. K. Acharya, Dict. of Hindu Arch . prasada).

The chapters on architecture in the Brhatsatahita of
Varahamihira (died 587 A.C.) as well as those of Matsya
and Bhavigya Puranas have in common another system of
classification relating to the division of temples (prasadas)
into twenty types. (Refs. Dict. of Hindu Architecture,
loc. cit) This division is based on the joint principles of
height (16, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 2 storeys), breadth (50, 43,
40, 34, 32, 30, 20, 16, 10, 8 and 4 cubits) and shape (those of
the lion, the elephant, the bird, etc. and those having sixteen
and eight angles). This curiously complex division is
traced in the Brhatsatahita to the still older work of Garga
which is probably connected with the Gargya Satahita of
which a Ms. is preserved in the Trinity College Library at
Cambridge.

Yet another scheme of classification with which we are
immediately concerned is found (with minor variations in
the titles and descriptions of the types) in the architectural
chapters of the Agni and the Garuda Puranas. In these works
the temples are divided into five types, called Viraja, Pug-
paka, Kailasa, Manika (in the Agni Purana) [Malika in the
Garuda Purana], and Trivistapa. Of these the first is said to
be a square (caturasra), the second rectangular (tadayata),
the third circular (vrtta), the fourth oval (vrttayata) and the
last octangular (ag{déra). Each of these five types is divided
into nine sub-groups, bringing the total to forty-five. (For
references, see P. K. Acharya, op. cit., . v. prasdda). The
same five-fold division is reproduced in an early mediaeval

Google
A RARE INDIAN TEMPLE-TYPE IN CAMBODIA 109

work, the Samarangenaeitradhara, attributed to king Bhoja
(probably the renowned Bhoja Paramara of Malwa who
reigned from c. 1040-1055 A.C.). In chapter 49 of this work.
we are told that the Lord Brahmi created the five classes of
golden palaces (vimanas), viz., the vairdja, the kailasa,
the puspaka, the manika, and the trivigtapa for himself, for
Siva, for Kubera, for Varuna, and for Indra respectively.
He also made temples of stone and burnt brick of the same
types for the adornment of towns. These five types are
said to have the same shapes, (square, rectangular, circular,
oval and octangular), as the types of the Agni and the
Garuda Puranas. But while the earlier works mention only
forty-five sub-types, the Samaranganacitradhara raises the
number to sixty-four, by dividing the vairdja or square type
into twenty-four sub-groups and the rest into ten each.

The nine sub-types of temples comprised in the Agni
and the Garuda Puranas under the head vairdja includes a
class of which unfortunately we have different readings in
different text-editions and Mes. of the same. It is called
nandaka in the Poona edition of the Agni Purana, while
the Cafcutta edition reads it as nandika. The Calcutta edi-
tion of the Garuda Purana gives the reading nandana. In
different Mes. of the Agni Purana referred to in the Poona
edition the readings are given as nandaka and nandana. It
is a curious fact that not a single concrete reference to this
type has been found in the general or epigraphical literature
of India and till lately in the literature of the countries in-
fluenced by Indian culture. Happily, this want has now
been supplied by a recent discovery in Cambodia. In
course of his works of clearance among the group of
temples at Roliioh which belong to the reign of indra-
varman | (877-889 A.C.), M. G.A.Trouvé discovered in
1932 and 1935 two inscribed foundation stéles of the temples
of Préh K6 and Bakon. These inscriptions have since been
published by M. Goedés in his very valuable corpus of ins-
criptions of Cambodia (Inscriptions du Cambodge, t. I,
pp. 17 ff.) Stanza 34 of the Bakon inscription, which follows

4

1i6 U. N. GHOSHAL

an enumeration of the pious acts of the king, runs as
follows :—
ydsyami sugatim pasead=asto=ayam lokanandanah |
Ifi=va sa dayavistah kalpayamasa nandikam ||

What the poet intends to convey in this typical bit of
kavya is, as M. Coedés has well explained, that the king
built a nandika with the intention that it would become
public after his death.

The above verse furnishes a happy instance of the way
in which Indian archaeology and the archaeology of Greater
India may be made to complete and supplement each other.
In the first place, it definitely fixes nandika as the correct
designation of the type of temples of which the Indian Mss.
and printed editions of the Agni and the Garuda Puranas
have given us several variant readings. In the second place,
it helps to fix the lower limit of origin of this particular type
of temples. If a nandika could be bi
in the latter part of the ninth century, its beginnings in i
original Indian home may safely be traced back at least to
century earlier. It may be recalled in this connection that
small flat-roofed temples consisting of a cella with a terrace
in front and often surrounded by a pillared hall are charac-
teristic of a class of shrines in the Gupta period. _Interest-
ing examples of this kind are furnished by the temple No. 17
at Sanchi as well as the ruined temples at Bhumara and
Nachna-Kuthara. We may safely cla: such temples
under the general head vairdja and even, as will be shown
presently, under the sub-type nandika or its parallels. The
apsidal temples of the Gupta Age like those at Ter and
Chezarla would belong to the general type manika (or
malika) of the Agni and the Garuda Puranas.

We may next consider whether we can identify any of
the known constructions of Indravarman | of Cambodia
with the sub-type nandika. M. Parmentier in his illu-
minating article on the art of Indravarman (BEFEO., t.
XIX, p. I ff.) notices several characteri of this art
distinguishing it alike from the primitive and the classical

Google
A RARE INDIAN TEMPLE-TYPE IN CAMBODIA our

Khmer art. Among these features may be mentioned the
system of isolated temples with side towers, the octagonal
pillars, the decoration of entrepilasters and so forth.
Frequent traces are also found in these constructions of
terraces. It is easy to see that the square plan of Ind
varman’s buildings agrees with the general type vai
above mentioned. Indeed, when M. Parmentier distinguishes
(op. cit., 66). the square plan of Indravarman’s buildings
from the rectangular structure of the primitive art, we may
describe the contrast in the technical language of the
Indian Silpagastras. We may say that it marked the transition
from the pugpaka to the vairdja style of architecture. The
side towers and the terraces present a more interesting
problem. The Samarafganasitradhara, as we have observed
before, gives sixty-four sub-types (instead of the usual
forty-five) of the five main groups of temples, and it adds
a short description of each. One of the sub-types called
nandi or nanda is described (Ibid., ch. 49, vv. 89-91) as
follows:
ayam samantad-utksipto = vdhya-lindam vind yada|
madhyam4@=linda-saudha (stha stham?)
karnaprasadakai=écitah ||
prathama=lindagarbhau ca samutkgiptatarau tatah |
sydtam chhddyadvaychchannauh tada@ nando"
bhidhiyate ||
From the context it follows that this sub-class is taken by
the author to be a modification of the one immediately
described above , viz., vijaya, which again is a simplifica-
tion of the preceding type prthivijaya. As we understand
this difficult and obscure text, it seems that the characteris-
tic features of the nanda type (according to the above-
named authority) are as follows: cella resting on four
pillars (“‘garbham catustambham’’ of the prthivijaya type),
the third and outermost terrace (alinda) wanting, but still
raised on all four sides above the ground level, the second
and the middlemost terrace covered with side-towers, the
first and innermost terrace raised higher up and covered

112 U. N. GHOSHAL

with double roofing (gabled roof?). We give below our
conjectural reconstruction of this type : —

GABLEO
ROOF

From the close similarity of names we may identify the
nandi or nanda of the Samarahgana with the nandika of
the Agni and the Garuda Puranas. In that case the terraces
and side-towers of Indravarman’s buildings would fit in with
the recorded descriptions of the nandika-nandi-nanda in the
Indian technical treatises. That king Indravarman in all his
constructions was not a mere copyist is shown by a signi-
ficant verse in the same Bakon inscription to which we have
referred above. Stanza 8 of this inscription is as follows:

Srimatsimhasanam Srindra-yanam Srindravimanakam |
Srindraprasadakam haimam bheje yas=svadhiya krtam||

This evidently means that the king designed new types
of conveyances (ydna), palaces (vimana) and temples
(prasada) wi he called after his own name.

Recherches Aroheologiques a Begram Par J. Hackin
avac Ia collaboration de Madame J. R. Hackin (Memoires
de la Delegation Archoologique Francaise en Afghanistan,
Tome 1X), 2 Vols., Les editions d’Art et Histoire, Paris,
1939. Price not stated.

All students of Indian Art should be greatly indebted
to Monseiur and Madame Hackin for bringing to light, and
to the Delegation Archéologique Francaise for publishing,
a series of valuable documents bearing on the history of
the Mathura school of sculpture. During May to July
1927 Monsieur and Madame Hackin conducted certain ex-
cavations at an old Buddhist site at Begram, 45 kilometres
from Kabul,—excavations which were richly rewarded by
the discovery of certain painted glasses, potteries and
certain other miscellaneous antiquities and the remnants
of a series of ivory cofferets, boxes, and architectural
pieces. The group of carved and incised livory pieces
constitutes a remarkable series of documents of great sig-
nificance to the history of Indian sculpture. The works of
the school of Mathura sculpture (Mathura sildkaras) dating
from Kushan times and running into the Gupta period have
been very well known and studied, but the ivory fragments
with remarkably fine and significant carved figures and
incised drawings, discovered by M. Hackin, have indeed
brought to light a lost page in the history of Indian Art,
the like of which has not yet been traced in any part of
India. An additional significance is attached to the finds
owing to the fact that they are absolutely free from any
traces of foreign influence and are works of purely Indian
inepiration (‘‘d’inspiration purement indienne”)—a fact
which gains additional significance when we remember
that they have come from the heart of Hellenistic culture in
the East,—very near to the ancient sites of Baktria, Kapi

and Gandhara. The question naturally arises if these
carvings were imported from India or executed locally by
a guild of ivory carvers from Mathura. If we compare
them with specimens of stone sculpture from old sites of
Mathura, e.g-, those collected in the Mathura and the
Lucknow museums—we find they are not mere repetitions
of analogous style of the lit art, but display a freshness,
a spontaneity, and a versatility,—which distinguish them
from the traditional formula of the Mathura School—and
hold these groups of examples together in a unity of style,
which seem to suggest that they were worked out locally by
a guild of sculptors imported from Mathura. In some
motifs, they appear to recall the Yakeini types of Sanchi
and Bharhut, but the Yakginis are rendered in a more free
original and lively pose, and in a new stylistic convention
which can be clearly distinguished from the stylistic con-
ventions and the stereotyped poses and the fixed iconography
not only of the Sanchi and Bharhut Yaksinis, but also of
the Mathura Yakeinis, represented in the Mathura museum.
This divergent style can only be explained by the fact that
Begram pieces illustrate the birth of a New School of Art
—the Mathura School in a nascent stage—of which the
developed, later, and decadent phases are illustrated in
the examples which have survived in India. Following
the Early Indian Art (represented by the remains of Sanchi
and Bharhut), and, preceding the art of the Gupta period
(principally represented at Sarnath),—we have the birth
and growth of a New School of sculpture,—that of Mathura,
which appears to cover a period of 400 years (circa let
century to 4th century A. D.). In the Begram remains we
have a glimpse of one of the early phases, if not the earliest
phase, of the Mathura School. A majority of the specimens
recovered at Begram, can hardly be designated as sculpture,
or even reliefs, and are mere incised drawings belonging
more to the domain of pictorial than of plastic Art. From
point of view, these drawings on ivory tablets and plaques
add to our knowledge of the state of Indian pictorial art

‘bout the 2nd century A. D.—of which no other evidence
ilable, either at Ajanta, or elsewhere. This class of
incised drawings (without very little, if any, manner of
modelling) typically illustrated by Figs. 64, 107, and
221. The last example, a charming study of a Young
Woman with a Swan, may perhaps represent the Type of
‘a Hamsini maid’. Indeed, many of the women and girls
represented in this series do not represent Yakginis, as
M. Hackin suggests, but most probably represent secular
types of nayikds, the “heroines of love-lore,”” indicated in
the Rasa-sastras. Some of the duets in conventional poses
(e.g-, Figs. 208, 211, 212) may represent Yaksini pairs of
cult symbolism, but others in freer story-telling and dramatic
poses (e.g., PI. xl, Fig. 70, Pl. xxxi, Fig. 88) are un-
doubtedly meant to represent nayikés (‘‘love-heroines”)
of Indian erotology. Many of these nayika pairs, ‘lover
and her confidante’’ (sakhi) represent ‘toilette scenes’—
dressing and ‘decorating’ for a meeting with the beloved
(Fig. 66). One (Fig. 67) appears to illustrate a Navodhd, a
newly-wed, shy and modest lover—led by her confidante
to her Lord, frequently illustrated in Rajput miniatures.
M. Hackin has made some very appreciative comments
on the exceptionally high quality of some of these nayikas"
toilette scenes and nayikas (not identified as such):
L’ensemble que nous venons de décrire est d’une qualité
exceptionelle. C’est I’élégance d’Amaravati mais exprimée
par une étre physique trés différent’” (p. 90). Though re-
calling and related to some of the Amaravati figures, they
have to be clearly distinguished from the types of the
Amaravati School. Yet the link with Amaravati (almost
contemporary with Early Mathura School) is not entirely
lacking. The most typical connections are offered by the
vegetable motifs, the supernatural animal types (jalebha,
jala-turaga, jala-hastins, makaras, leo-gryphs, and other
marine monsters). M. Hackin somewhat complacently
assumes that these various types of marine monsters which
figure in early Buddhist’Art, are necessarily of extra-Indian

Google
16 NOTICES OF BOOKS

origin, ignoring recent researches which have traced their
forms to Vedic sources. As Codrington and other scholars
have pointed out, these marine monsters occurring in
various schools of Early Indian Art are “undoubtedly
indigenous.” Two distinctly foreign types occur in this
series of carved ivories. The first is represented by a type
of maid-servant or female attendant, or retainers who wear
akind of narrow trousers (See Figs. 329, 156, 157, 158).
They recall identical types represented on the reliefs at
Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda. Another foreign type is
the Gandharan version of river-goddess wearing a chemise
and standing on makara (Figs. 77, 78) and clearly distin-
guished from the Indian version with the upper body un-
covered (Fig. 79). The latter example stands on two
it and a jala-turaga with scales,

recalling
early reliefe at Amaravati (circa let century B.C.). A
typically Hellenistic figure is the bronze bust of Athena
(Nos. 241, 142). M. Hackin has drawn attention to a very
remarkable plaque (Fig. C, Fig. 137) which undoubtedly
illustrates an archaic Sumerian motif (cited in an example
from Farah, Fig. D). it represents a group of lions and
human beings, intimately grouped, and representing some
pre-historic Indo-Sumerian cult-symbols, if we can judge
from analogous groups discovered at Mohenjo-daro. The
Begram piece offers a very significant example of Indiani-
zation of extra-Indian religious motifs, and the indigenous
Indian style which translates the Sumerian cult in the
characteristic plastic language of India, amply demonstrates
that a borrowing of motif does not import any manner of
fluence’ on the native Indian language of Plastic Art.
This ie further demonstrated by the Mathura versions of
the anguipéde (Figs. 73, 74, 199), a marine monster of the
dolphin type, with two tails symmetrically disposed and
held in two hands, of which Hellenistic versions occur in
Gandhara reliefs. Here the Indian versions introduce
original features, replacing the tails by two makaras from

the jaws of which emerge a Yakga goblin (Fig. 73). The
author cites a fragment of a Greco-Buddhist bas-relief
from Shotorak (near Begram) (Fig. 109) which illustrates
a typically Indian makara-torana (placed on two lonic
pillars) (the so-called ‘‘léo-griphes”” are actually makaras)
and incidentally illustrates the “influence” of Indian Art on
Hellenistic Sculpture, if borrowing of motifs can be taken as
evidence of ‘‘influences’’. The question of the date of
these exquisite ivory pieces is of some consequence to
the history of Indian Art, in general, and of the Mathura
School, in particular. The author compares them with
and relates them to the examples of the museums of
Mathura and Lucknow belonging to the epoch of the Great
Kuganas (Ist to 3rd century A. D.), and suggests (at p. 22)
a date between the end of the 3rd century and the begi
ning of the 4th century, A.D., on the basis of their
astonishing virtuosity, their happy skill and perfection of
technique. On the basis of certain Kharogthi lett

century is suggested. The present reviewer is
date the pieces a little earlier on the basis of a stylistic
comparison with typical examples of Mathura stone-reliefs.
The author alludes to certain ‘‘traces d’influence hellénis-
tique”” which are not demonstrated. He however rightly
emphasises the fact that the Begram pieces remain
faithful to the artistic tradition of India, inspite of the fact
that the Buddhist Art of Mathura displays some innovations
coming from the North-west (?). He further remarks,
(noticing the independent and original character of these
decorated and figured ivories), that in the north of India,
the secular art appears to rebel against foreign influences,
to which the religious Buddhist Art openly patronised by
the invaders, appears to easily submit itself.

The work is in two parts, the first being the volume of

As Monsieur Jules Bloch remarks in the Foreword to this
excellent volume, “it is a boon not only to the student of
history but also to the literary man and to everybody inter-
ested in Tamil Literature.” Mr. Dikshitar is an historian
of Tamil culture and he has already given evidences of

ing tantalizing glimpses of the data imbedded in
ancient Tamil Literature. There has been a demand
for easy and direct access to the ancient Tamil Texts, and
the historian has generously come forward to give an accu-
rate translation of one of the famous epics of early Tamil
culture—a task properly due from a student of Literature.
But we thank the historian all the same for undertaking
this arduous task and disclosing the direct evidences bear-
ing on many phases of Tamilian history and culture. The
present reviewer is not competent to appraise the quality
of the translation but those competent to judge have already
praised the faithful character and accuracy of this render-
ing. accuracy which, at times, has gone to the extreme
length and demand a freer version. But, as an historian,
he has been scrupulous in presenting his evidences in a
strictly accurate translation. For this document, though
primarily a justly famous epic,—is a museum of infor-
mations of many phases of early culture in the South. The

commercial and asthetic have been carefully distinguished
and commented on in a very learned Introduction which
is the author’s original contribution to study of this famous
Epic. As a culture-Saga, the ‘Story of the Anklet’ covers
the triple kingdoms of the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas,
and Pattini the deified heroine, worshipped and prayed
to by all the earth, made the Chola king realize the truth
of the old saying that the chastity of virtuous women would
not be meritorious if the valiant monarch did not rule
properly ; again she made the Pandyan, the guardian of
the Southern regions, realize that the king would not live
if his sceptre swerved from justice ; further, the Chera
king of the Western regions was made to feel that the
wrath incurred by true monarchs would not be appeased
till their sworn vows were fulfilled so as to be known to
the kings of the Northern regions. This map of Tamil
culture, therefore, includes within its orbit and has knit
together the three sister kingdoms of the South, famous in
history. The quality of the Epic poem, (divided into 23
brilliant cantos in three Books), is of an unique aesthetic
a harmonious combination of the lyrical,
and the grandiose. No other Epic in the
world can rival, or stand comparison with its original rasa
values. Take for instance, the ‘sea-shore songs’ (Canto
VII). Their lyrical fragrance and their imaginative flavour
are hard to beat in any language. But we are more con-
cerned, here, with historical information and antiquarian
data which the Epic provides in abundance to the students
of antiquity. The great Karikala Chola, immortalized by
the Sangam poets, the author of the Kevery dams, the
builder of the commercial and maritime capitals Pukar and
Kaveripattanam, is pictured in the Epic with picturesque
details. The portrait of Nedunchallyan, the contemporary
Pandyian King is also drawn on the canvas of this Epic
in vivid colours and piquant details. The Chera King
Senguttuvan also comes to life in the pages of this
remarkable Saga. But much more interesting is the yivid

glimpse that we get of the international city of Pukar,
with its foreign colony of Yavanas, its merchants, and
traders, artists, artisans and soldiers, and the detailed
description of the various quarters of the city, each with
its particular social group—with its marts, markets, and
shrines—is of intense interest. The description of the
celebration of the Indra’s festival (now alas, extinct!) is one
of the finest cantos in the Epic. It helps us to visuali:
the life of the times with vivid and cinematographic
details. Many significant details help to fix not only the
date of this Epic, which has been hitherto exaggerated by
Tamil patriots, but also offer materials to fix the date of
the evolution of many phases of Indian culture. Although
the Epic cannot be placed earlier than the second
century A. D., it helps to fix the dates of other phases of
Indian culture. The cult histories of Siva, Visnu,
Skanda and other forms of the divinity receive new and
significant lights. The temple and the worship of Siva
and other deities are frequently referred to. One quota-
tion will suffice: “‘At that time the thunder of the morning
drum rose high accompanied by the blowing of the white
conch from the temples of Siva with the forehead eye, of
Vignu with the Garuda standard, of Baladeva with the
plough and of Subrahmanya with the cock-flag, and from
the residences of those proclaiming dharma as well as from
the palace of the victorious king."’ (Canto XIV; 1-14).
There are two significant references which establish the
antiquity of the’Tirupati shrine—to “‘the red-eyed Lord,
dwelling on the topmost crest of the tall and lofty hill
named Venkatam” (Canto XI, 56). But while the Epic
offers to admiring gaze the rich panorama of the life and
culture of the South, vividly portrayed with interesting
‘details—the evidences disclosed in the text establish
beyond all shadow of doubt that the culture that is dis-
closed in the pages of this text—is a culture deeply im-
penetrated and dominated by a Sanskrit culture—appa-
rently imported from the North, Not only eleven per cent

of the text (as demonstrated by the author in Appendix !)
is loaded with Sanskrit words—the whole system and the
framework of the society pictured, the ideals of religion
and of morality are all borrowed from Aryan, and non-
Tamil sources. Even the poetical imageries, the metaphors,
and similes and the rhetorical conventions are bodily
taken and adopted from Sanskrit Literature. In the field
of religion and image-worship, the names of the Vedic
and the Pauranic gods, which occur in this text prove
beyond doubt “‘that the assimilation and the blend of two
cultures, Sanskrit and Tamil, was a thing of the ancient
past”. And grievous must be the disappointment of
those who have been fed on the promise that early Tamil
Literature offers an antique and original culture, clearly
to be distinguished from the Aryan Sanskrit culture of the
North. May be, the earlier poems, the Seven Idylls are
the repository of the unique, original, and independent
pre-Aryan Tamil culture in its aboriginal purity and
simplicity free from the shadow of rainbow colours
of Sanskrit Literature. But the Silappadikaram not-
withstanding many local touches, here and there, does
not represent the “well of Tamil Culture undefiled,”
but is coloured heavily by the thick paints of the
Sanskrit palette, which conceal rather than reveal the
primitive and original texture of the native Tamil genius
and its unique ways of thought and expression. To
complete the survey, the earlier and the later Sagas—
the Seven Idylls and the Manimekhalai—demand a
similar exposition and it is hoped that some other scholar,
if not Mr. Dikshitar himself, should give us translations of
other Tamil texts on the excellent model set by our author.
‘Apart from social and political institutions and data
provided in this Epic, there is a wealth of material avail-
able for an elaborate study of music and dancing; though
‘dramatic poetry’ is vaguely mentioned, there is no evi-
dence of the existence of drama proper (nafakam) as such.

the Tamil names of ya! and isai, but there is no ancient
Tamil word corresponding to nafaka. The mudrds and
the ‘hands of gesticulations’ are referred to under the name
of pindi. But it is not suggested that 24 different mudras
have been evolved at the time of this Epic. Only
eleven modes of body-movement and limb-movements
(same the Bharata text) are referred to. Even the
mythical ot of Dancing, though localised with the
cult of Agastya, and the ‘staff’ (talaikkol) symbolical of
Jayanta-figures jarjara in the text of Bharata, and must
be an adaptation of earlier Sanskrit legends. Our author
very ably shifts the data of music and musical instruments
and establish that ya! and vind are different instrumet
But he appears to exaggerate the difference between Tamil
and early northern music. The 22 érutis, and the seven
notes derived from the voice of seven animals, are obvious-
ly derived by Tamilians from the northern musical lore,
and it is useless to claim originality for Sastric Tamil
music by suggesting the theory of parallel ideas. Undoub-
tedly, the folk-music of the Tamil represented an original
culture—but, as the author points out, the native Tamil
music was forgotten even in the time of Adiyarkku-
nallar (p. 369), and ‘‘South Indian music seems to
follow largely the theory modes, and notation of early
Sanskrit musicians.’ We have nothing but high praise
for the learned Introduction (74 pages) and the elaborate
notes given at the foot of the text. At times, the Notes
border on cheap generalisations, e.g., when in connection
with the ‘quantity marks’ branded on the bales of good
the author runs to ‘pictographic writings’ and ‘South India’s
intercourse with Egypt’! At one place the author is led
to remark that chariots drawn by horses were not in vogue
at the time, a suggestion which is contradicted by many
passages in the text (V, 157-158). The tying of tali is never
practised in Northern Indian marriages in the upper castes
(p. 57), so that other 1 customs have to be investigated

ceded by various scholars. The author has given a list
of instances ‘pp. 64-65) to prove that the author of the Epic
had first-hand knowledge of the Sanskrit works on drama
and music as well as of the Sanskrit Epics and the Puran:
which corroborate the author's remark that “Tamil imagi
nation has been from very early times influenced by Aryan
Culture."" The text of the Silappadikéram amply proves
the fundamental unity of Indian culture in the North and
in the South. And the author has earned the gratitude
of all lovers of Indian culture by presenting this unique
material in a worthy form and in the spirit of accurate
and unbiassed scholarship.

Mlustrations of Indian Sculpture Mostly Southern—By
F. H. Gravely and C. Sivaramamurti, Introduction, 45
plates, Madras, 1939,

These two handy and extremely useful monographs from
the indefatigable pen of the Superintendent of the Madras
Government Museum and his assistants make a fresh
addition to the list of their valuable contributions on South
Indian art and archaeology. In the short but informative
Preface to the Guide, the authors modestly state their
objects to be “to provide somewhat fuller information than
has been possible in the labels, and to present it in a form
in which it can be taken away for future reference”. In
actual fact, they give a luminous survey of South Indian
Art in its different branches from the earliest times to the
present. In the Guide the authors, after a short introduction
tracing the history of Indian art down to the Gupta times,
deal with the early sculpture as represented by Amaravati
and the northern schools. This preliminary survey introduces
us to short sections on South-Indian architecture and sculp-
ture followed by shorter notices of East Indian sculpture, of

South Indian scripts and of coins. An archaeological map
and a short, but extremely valuable appendix on Hindu,
Buddhist and Jaina iconography, four plates and as many
drawings complete this interesting work. Some of the
authors’ accounts, e.g., of the four periods of Amaravati
and related art (pp. 4-7), of the five periods of Tamilian
architecture illustrated with drawings (pp. 16-19), of the
corresponding periods of Tamilian sculpture (pp. 22-24),
are models of lucid, accurate and ample exposition. The
authors show their good sense in explaining (p. 11) the
resemblance of Gupta art to the art of classical Greece, not
as a result of western influence but as that of parallel
development. Considering its extreme usefulness, the
price of this monograph seems to be remarkably chea:

We offer below a few suggestions for consideration of
the learned authors in a case a second edition is called for.

P. 2—“The Buddl were not only the earliest
Indian historians but, with the Jains, were also the first
to develop sculpture in stone”. The fact is that the un-
certainties of Indian literary chronology are so great that
it is difficult to say who are the earliest Indian historians.
The Buddhist canon, it is true, contains germs of Buddha's
biography and Buddhist church-history, but might not the
oldest Puranas presumably containing dynastic lists with
didactic observations be equally or even still more ancient?
A Bhavigyat Purani any rate existed earlier than
Apastamba’s Dharmasiitra. As to the second point, can we
attribute Buddhist or Jaina connections to such pre-Maurya
or Maurya sculptures as the stone figures from Patna,
Besnagar and Parkham which most probably belong to
the cult of yaksas and yaksinis? Even the Jaina origin
ofthe nude torso with Mauryan polish described by the
late Dr. K. P. Jayaswal in the JBORS. and now deposited
in the Patna Museum has still to be definitely proved.

P. 3—“The ruined ‘Lad Khan’ temple at Aihole near
Badami seems to be the most southerly monument [of the
Guptas]"". Considering that the Aihole stands altogether

Google

NOTICES OF BOOKS 128

outside the zone of the Gupta empire, it seems desirable
to replace ‘Gupta art’ of commonly accepted nomenclature
by the term ‘Gupta-Vakataka art’. Attention may
drawn to the fact that the late Mr. R. D. Banerji his
“Age of the Imperial Guptas’, has, contrary to the usual
view, attributed the Lad Khan temple to’ Kirtivarman | of
the Western Calukya dynasty.

P. &—“Graeco-Buddhist art seems to have originated in
(or before) the reign apparently long and peaceful of the
Scythian Azes I... It had a brief but brilliant revival in
the ‘Indo-Afghan’ sculpture of about 400 A.D. or a little
later”. Azes I was certainly a renowned ruler whose
chief exploit appears to have been the conquest of the
Eastern Punjab from its last Greek king Hippostrates. He
has also been supposed to be the founder of the Vikrama
era. But his family was Persian, not Saka. Again if Dr.
Tarn is right in identifying the figure on one of Maues’
coin types as that of Buddha, the beginnings of Buddhist
art must go back some twenty years earlier than Azes I's
time. The term ‘Indo-Afghan’ made fashionable by Si
John Marshall is open to the objection that it might suggest,
. onthe analogy of Indo-Persian art, the wholly mistaken
idea of joint Indian and Afghan cultural influences.

P, 9—~The Graeco-Buddhist sculptures exhibited in-
clude Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in Greek robes”. The
robes of the Gandharan Buddha are the usual monastic
of the Buddhist bhikgu, while those of the
in Bodhisattvas are the ordinary Indian princely
garments.

P. 9—“The Lomas Rai Cave in the Barabar Hills with a
frieze of elephants on its fagade’* are included among
“the few truly indigenous remains that survive from the
Maurya period”. In view of Dr. A. Banerji-Sastri’s obser-
vations, (JBORS., Vol. XII, pp. 49-52 and 58-62) it is not
improbable that the unique fagade of the Lomas Rsi Cave
was the work of Kaliiga artists during the raid of king
Khiravela.

P. 9—“The famous capitals of Asoka's edict-pillars are
in Persepolitan style."’ Usually the style is characterised
as Perso-Hellenistic, though there are other ys making
“the bell: partake the form of an up-turned
lotus of i ion or else deriving the same from
ic inheritance in which the art of

Persepolis also shared.
P. 10—"‘Indian art, instead of idealising man’s physi
and intellectual beauty as Greek art did, tended to idealise

rather his spirityal beauty......s0 much so that in the early
days of indigenous sculpture, the sacred figure of Buddha
was invariably represented symbolically, never in bodily
form as in Greco-Buddhist sculpture’’. Not to raise the
vexed question of origin of the Buddha image, it seems
clear that the early ban against Buddha's figure-representa-
tion was due to definite canonical prohibitions, which
probably reflect Buddha's keen desire to guard against the
danger of man-worship. In later times the Indian spiritual
ideal, 80 far from inhibiting the representation of Buddha,
helped to produce the magnificent creations of Gupta and
post-Gupta periods.

P.30—“With the probable exception of the elephant
above the Asoka edict at Dhauli......and of the sculptured
caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri......the earliest surviving
sculptures of the ancient Kaliiga kingdom and of Bengal
are from times considerably later than the close of the
Gupta period, from the art of which however they derived
their inspiration’. Attention has recently been drawn to
the fact that not only Gupta but also Kushan types of
sculpture, presumably of local origin, may be traced in
the art of ancient Bengal, which also points to the existence
of an old indigenous tradition, sharing with Gupta art in
the evolution of the art of the Pala period (See the valuable
paper of S. K. Saraswati, Early Sculpture of Bengal in Journ.
Dept. of Letters, Calcutta University, Vol, XXX, Calcutta,
1937).

P, 31—“Uddandapura, the Pala capital." The oldest

Google

NOTICES OF BOOKS 127

definite references to Uddandapura occur on two Buddha
pedestal inscriptions of the reign of Vigrahapala I (or Siira-
pala 1). A Tara image has also been found from the ruins
of the Bihar fort with an inscription of king Ramapala. But
probably the only Pala king having his capital at Uddanda-
pura was Govindapala who belonged to the latter part
of the 12th century, and was presumably overthrown by
Mubammad ibn Bakhtiyar.

P. 32—“Kharost! finally disappeared in about the
third century A.D.”. The Kharogthi records may be traced
down at least to the middle of the 5th century A.D.

Pp. 33-34—"Punch-marked puranas are. impressed
with three or four symbols each.....-The Puranas may be
presumed to have been issued by specially authorised local
authorities or persons’. The fact is that punch-marked
purdnas bear on the obverse a group of five symbols and on
the reverse two or three or otherwise a number of punches.
It has also been recently shown that the extraordinary unifor-
mity of these coins points to a central issuing authority
which is presumably that of the Maurya empire. (See John
Allan, A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British
Museum, London, 1939, Introduction, pp. xxi, xxx .

In conclusion, we would refer to a few misprints: —p. 9
‘charibearer’, ‘Didargange’s p. 5 ‘Charma’, ‘flour-de-lis’
p. II ‘roots’.

The Illustrations, which is a companion volume of the
Guide, contains good reproductions of a series of forty-five
sculptures mostly belonging to the Madras Museum. The illus-
trations are well selected and they include specimens from
some less well-known schools, such as the Andhra sculp-
ture from Goli (pl. x), Kaliaga sculptures from Mukhalingam
(pls. xvi-xvii), Early Eastern Calukyan sculptures (pls. xx-
xxi), Nolamba sculptures (pls. xxii-xxiii) and Kakatiya
sculpture (pl. xxvii). Naturally enough, the Tamilian
sculptures account for the largest number of illustrations
(ple. xxix-xlvi), showing the evolution from the Pallava
period to modern times.

We could wish that the provenance of some of the sculp-
tures (e.g. pl. xxi), should not have been left blank, also
that one or either of the famous Nateéa figures of the
Museum which roused the enthusiastic admiration of M.
Rodin, had been included, and that at least one more Pala
sculpture belonging to its early phase had found a place.
We would finally point out that the statement (Introduction,
p. 1): “The different schools of sculpture that developed
in the various kingdoms which arose [in Northern India]
on the downfall of the Gupta empire, are all based upon
that empire’s art” ignores, e.g., the vigorous indigenous
tradition of Bengal to which reference has been made above.

In this important publication, the author summarises a
number of Pajiji stories (Hikayat Paiiji Kuda Semirang, the
Cambodian Paiiji story, the Pafiji story from Serat Kanda,
Angrom Akung, Jayakusuma, Paiiji of Palembang, Pafiji
Kuda Naravangéa Malat). This is followed by the author's
comparison of the stories and his valuable remarks on their
general character. Differing from his predecessors, the
author thinks that Kalang (Gegelang), was the name of a
kingdom with a kraton of the same name which was situated
at the western foot of the Wilis. He further thinks that the
Pafiji stories originated in the post-Majapahit period and
were originally written in middle-Javanese.

Lecture on “American Interest in
Indian Culture”

Recently Calcutta had the opportunity of welcoming in
its midst Dr. Horace I. Poleman, Ph.D., Director of the
Library of Congress, Washington (U.S..A.), who was touring
in India in connection with his scheme of establishing cultural
contacts between India and America. At the invitation of
the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Dr. Poleman
read a paper in the rooms of the Institute on the 3rd August
1940 with Dr. Kalidas Nag, Joint Secretary of the Greater
India Society, in the chair. With the kind permission of
the Ramakrishna Institute we have pleasure in reproducing
below the main portion of this interesting paper.

“I shall consider the culture of India from two points
of view—its past and its future. Doubtless no American
interested in the humani would assert that Indic civiliza-
tion has been inconsequential in the past and is negligible
in our calculations for the future, yet doubtless few think in
an inclusive way of India’s accomplishments. Perhaps
Americans think exclusively, if at all, of your philosophy
and religion, And justly so. For aside from the abortive
“Aryanization” now being promulgated by the German High
Command, the Indo-European speaking peoples of India are
the only branch of that linguistic stock to have developed and
zealously preserved its own religious and philosophical con-
cepts—concepts which have resisted both intellectual and
armed invasions, and revolutions throughout historical times.
In the Rigveda one finds the well-developed result of pro-
found thinking on the part of your early séers. Much of
this thinking demands further clarification. In the Atharva-
veda a pre-Aryan folk-religion of magic appears, but the
substructure remained. Although the Upanishads form an
intellectual revolution with little remaining from the Vedas
except the adoration of the Pitrs, they are still characteris-
tic of Indian thought. And it is in the study of them that the

Google
130 AMERICAN INTEREST IN INDIAN CULTURE

foreign student is impressed by the lightning flashes of truth,
which inevitably affect his own evaluation of himself and his
world as well as of the early thinkers of India. The Upa-
nishads found their reaction in the still later growth of
ritualism on the one hand and the infusion of bhakti into
worship on the othes on an ever-increasing scale. How
much of these phases are Aryan in their progressive deve-
lopment and how much the adoption of the pre-Aryan ideas
is yet to be determined by a study of the primitive and
prehistoric. The impact of all this on the West result-d in
the German romantic movement of the 19th century to-
gether with the scientific study of the history and comparison
of religions. Much of the thinking of Schopenhauer eman-
ated from the Upanishads, and the responsibility for the
American Transcendentalist School of thought lies with India.

“In the realm of pure literature India’s contributions are
famous. Although the religious content is prominent,
it has not excluded a massive literature of epic, dtama—which
perhaps has a first place in antiquity,—folk-lore, law and
lyric poetry, as well as elaborate studies in linguistics, aes-
thetics, and the poetic art. No teaching of the history of
literature in the West can claim distinction without an
adequate consideration of India. The history of drama is
vitally concerned with India, the spread of folk-lore
through the West from India, where it goes deep into the
subsoil of culture, makes any treatment of that subject ludi-
crous without constant reference to Indian origins. Not
until recent times has any grammatical or linguistic work
approached in clarity, exactness and scientific perfection the
work of Panini and his followers. The study or rhetorical
principles and of all phases of law finds itself in the same
relation to India.

“Architecture and the plastic arts have had a career in
India which we can study since the third century B.C. India’s
art has had a unique history of theme and technique, and has
never been excelled for imaginative power. Schools of art
in the West are giving increasing attention. Our chief task

Google
‘AMERICAN INTEREST IN INDIAN CULTURE 131

in the expansion of stich study will be to furnish the neces-
sary implementation to the educational system of America.
“All phases of science have had a iong and independent
Position in Indian thinking. Medicine, astronomy, mathe-
matics and law need interpretation to the West. To mention
one aspect I was asked a number of years ago by a medical
research scientist if there is anything in the history of Indian
medicine referring to Caesarian section. As a result of my
studies of death-rituals in which this operation has figured I
was able to give him much interesting antiquarian material,
which was subsequently considered important enough to
publish for the scientific world. Medical science could
profit from a careful study of Indian mate
“Anyone unacquainted with Indian civilization in its
various departments does not know, or even begin to know,
the world-history of any one of those phases of culture.
“It will be my pleasant task in collaboration with cer-
tain others presently to persuade American educators to
acquaint their students with this civilization on a scale
hitherto unknown. The plan for the programme of the
development of Indic studies in America can best be stated
by quoting from a recent Bulletin of the American Coun-
cil of Learned Societies on “Indic Studies in America’ :
The programme will call for the training of two kinds of
Pereonnel—"“‘the one to be engaged primarily in Indological
research and in due time to fill the present chairs of Sans-
krit and similar chairs which may be instituted at other
great universities. The second kind of personnel to be
trained is one to carry Indological knowledge to a large
audience through the medium of other disciplines. These
men, trained in the Indian aspects of their fields—fine arts,
history, anthropology, political science, and a number of
other disciplines—would present India to the students in our
colleges and universities in a far more widely reaching
manner than is possible for the present few professors of
Sanskrit.
“In addition to the training and placing of personnel, we

Google
132 AMERICAN INTEREST IN INDIAN CULTURE

need implementation, particularly that which makes the
study of India possible to the large group peripheral to Indo-
logy and dependent upon the Indologists for the scientific
standard of the Indic materials it uses. It is true that the
implementation for Indic studies is better than it is in most
underworked fields, because there is already a tradition
(in America) of a century's scientific labour in many parts of
the field. But the implementation will not suffice for the
expansion of Indic studies beyond their present limits.

“For the production of both the personnel and the imple-
mentation, we need a strong American school in India. The
American School of Indic and Iranian studies was organized
in 1934, primarily for the purpose of assuming responsibility
for the excavations at Chanhu-daro. Its very modest pledges
of funds, first made in 1930, evaporated during the depres-
sion, and even the excavations which were started on con-
tributed money have not yet been satisfactorily completed.
At some time the School will establish headquarters in
Benares, where it will serve as a centre of training for younger
American schol provide a radial point for the use of
Americans conducting humanistic research in India, and
participate in the revaluation of Indic culture which the
Indians are making for themselves.

“The present status of Indic studies sets the problems
of that field peculiarly before the humanities, and it is
scholars of the humanities who must urge the development of
Indic studies in the West. These studies offer a vast and
fruitful field for research, they will be a tool for comptehend-
ing the world which is now coming to be and for meeting its
needs, they will enrich humanistic studies and validate the
humanistic approach to understanding.

“So much for the past. It is a rich past, But in glory-
ing in that past, do not lose sight of the future. It will be
less than futile, it will be degenerate to be content to revel
in that past without planning a vigorous future. There have
been great thinkers in your past. There are some to-day.
It i@ reasonable to suppose that the reflective tradition will

Google
AMERICAN INTEREST IN INDIAN CULTURE 133

carry on, but inevitably modified by modern scientific
approaches. Much revaluation of this past must be accom-
plished within India itself as it is to be applied to current and
future problems and thought. Such revaluation is already
appearing, but those reactionaries who refuse to revalue,
who insist upon the continuance of traditional values with-
out submitting them to a searching, as well as sympathetic,
analysis, will be discredited in the West. The students of
American colleges to-day are no longer the playboys of the
first quarter of this century. They are hard-thinking, deter-
mined realists, looking eagerly for real values wherever
they can find them, They will not be interested in vague
shoutings about the omnipotent Om, and secret, mystical
interpretations of what may be realistically evaluated. We
on our side stand indicted for many mistakes and false
values, so that we must also let ourselves in for evaluations.
We need intellectual understanding on each side to make
a satisfactory adjustment of East with West. Much patience
and co-operation will be needed.

“But to get down to specific points. Philosophy and
religion assume a new place in our development. The man
of to-day must be less concerned with whether a Christ or a
Krishna were divine incarnations than he must be concerned
with whether what they taught will work in the planning
of a good and healthy life for himself and fellow-beings.
“Spiritual’’ fads, creeds, and dogmas will not help. They
will only embitter and destory. Ignorance must succumb
to education. An old manuscript must be revered not
because it is the supposed holy utterance of a seer, but
because it is an expression of an intellect, which may have
intellectual value for us. Where truth exists it will be re-
cognized, but only when bias and clap-trap have been
clearly shorn away from it. I have noticed three kinds of
scholars in India: the reactionary who is impatient of all
modern scientific methods, who is content with a traditional
point of view exclusively; a second type who is still in the
gtip of medievalism and loves nothing so much as to argue

the relative merits of this or that mantra for the attainment
‘of soul-force. (There are similar minds in the West too.)
And finally there is the third who justly dissatisfied with
much of the Western evaluation of Eastern learning carefully
searches in his laboratory of technical jnstruments or in his
mind for an unprejudiced and just treatment of his subject.
Yes, India is well on the way toward a severe and critical
attitude toward herself, but there are still many elements
within her which would dissuade her from the work. The
eyes of the West will be increasingly upon you, expectant,
eager, but critical. Search yourselves well.

“Turning from the world of ideas to that of scientific
research | would like to indicate briefly some of the work
which remains to be done.

“The archaeologist's spade has only begun to turn up
the facts necessary for the understanding of the prehistoric
as it has affected the historic. So much that is unexplored
in the past requires the light of intense archaeological work.
To penetrate the secret of the origin of Indian art, for ex-
ample, will require much delving into the earth-bound past.
it may never be penetrated, but a working hypothesis for
its origins may, be forthcoming.

“In the field of languages considerable scientific analysis
is still needed, for Sanskrit itself and the literary dialects of
antiquity. The monumental work of the Petersburg Lexicon
frequently falls short of the requirements of the scholar work-
ing in any phase of Sanskrit literature, since so much of that
literature remains unexplored. In philosophy and religion
there are numerous unpublished texts dealing with medieval
theories and practices. Mediaeval texts on rituals remain
almost unexplored. Much of modern religious practices have
yet to come under any scientific observation, In the realm
of pure literature there are texts to be published for the West.
Even of the standard and long known texts, some are still
not published in critical editions. For example, the M
bharata which is now receiving such excellent editorial

treatment at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute at
Poona.

“Many of the modern tongues of India remain to be
studied scientifically. Dravidian and Munda languages have
vast uncharted spaces.

“In the fields of anthropology and ethnology the concep-
tions of the racial history of India will probably be subject to
correction as the necessary investigations are pursued.

“The history of India will constantly be revised in the
light of new inscriptions, numismatics, and literary evidence.
Not too much is known about political and economic theory
and practice in ancient India. Sociology lacks a satisfactory
explanation of even so fundamental an element of Indian life
as the caste system. The study of Hindu and Moslem cultures
in their interrelations is practically a virgin field. If the world
is to know India it must have much more material from her
scholars that exists at present. We in the West will assist
in whatever way we can.

“For the pursuit of this work much organization and
co-operation must be developed. Each of us has his pet
interests, but we must try to consider them as they relate
to the work of others, for no one field exists alone. The
ethnographical work of a man in Bengal must be considered
by the Malayalam. The archaeologist of Eastern India must
keep his eye on the man in Sind. Since scholars are also
human beings they find it easier to criticise than to co-operate.
And in a country where non-co-operation has in some respects
become a disease, the elements of disorganization must be
specially kept under control.

“| hope that as India develops as a nation she will also
develop a national centre for the direction of cultural studies,
for the collection of the data, and the distribution of it
abroad.

“The interpretation of India to America will depend
more on what you do than upon the small group of its own
scholars and educators in the Indic field. Rightly or wrong-
ly your ideas for the time being will be measured by Western

many isms of our own to contend with now.) Give us cold,
reasoned facts, and arguments without passion or sentimen-

than any dependent upon other appeals.

The Third Session of the Indian History Congress,
Calcutta, 1939

The Third session of the Indian History Congress was
held on three successive days (I5th, 16th and 17th
December 1939) in the commodious compound and rooms
of the Asutosh Buildings of the Calcutta University. By a
happy forethought of the authorities concerned, it had
been decided to hold the Sixteenth session of the Indian
Historical Records Commission at the same venue imme-
diately before the History Congress. The result was seen in
the record attendance of members and delegates representing
almost all the Indian Universities as well as the Government
‘departments and other institutions interested in the cause
of historical research in this country. The session of the
Congress was opened on the forenoon of the 15th December
in a spacious and beautiful pandal specially erected for
the occasion within the compound of the University Build-
ings. The proceedings started with a fine welcome address
delivered by the Chairman of the Reception Committee
(Hon. Khan Bahadur M. Azizul Haque), who said that
Bengal might not have historic sites of as great an antiquity
as some of the sites in northern and western India but still
she could boast of her historic sites like Tamluk and
Tribeni, Bishnupur and Jessore, Mahasthan and Paharpur,
Nabadvip and Vikrampur, Satgaon and Pandua, Gaud
and Murshidahad, Dacca and Chittagong, and above all
of Calcutta as the place where was laid the foundation of
modern India and where the pioneers in the fields of Indian
history began their work and the university organised syste-
matic studies and researches into India’s past. H.E. the
Governor of Bengal then inaugurated the Congress by
saying that although the Congress was a comparatively
recent body, it represented a long and distinguished tradi-
tion of historical scholarship and that he recognised the

138 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS, CALCUTTA, 1939

value of historical researches inasmuch as there was no
such thing as a past which could be conveniently divorced
from the present. After His Excellency’s speech, the
Report of the Proceedings of the last session having been
presented by the General Secretary (Sir Shafaat Ahmad
Khan), the General President (Dr. R.C. Majumdar) delivered
his thoughtful address. His speech, besides taking stock
of the work of the previous year, contained a valuable
warning against the regional and denominational tendencies
in certain modern historical writings, and offered a number
of fruitful suggestions for future guidance. ‘‘In the ancient
period’, he said, ‘Indian History and civilisation were
vitally connected with the great civilisations which flourished
in Western Asia and Africa, and later they were still more
closely associated with practically the whole of Northern
and Eastern Asia. In the mediaeval period, India was a vital
link in the great chain of Islamic civilisation which bound
together a considerable part of the ci ed world. Of the
modern period I need say but little, as it ie too patent to
everybody how the events happening almost on the opposite
side of the globe are shaping the political destiny of the
country and seriously affecting her moral, material, and
economic conditions. It is obvious to me that we cannot
follow the currents of Indian history as phenomena isolated
from the rest of the world. I also find it difficult to believe
that a school of Indian History can really develop in In
unless our historical studies are widened and placed on a
broader basis.” Turning to the dangers facing Indian
istorical scholarship, he insisted that the historians must
rise above nationalism and “break down the barrier of
im and overcome the influence of communalism
in historical studies."" Proceeding with his theme he
lamented the great short-coming of Indian scholarship, viz.»,
“the lack of first-hand knowledge about Chinese, Tibetan
and other foreign sources of Indian history,” and the dearth
of Indian scholars in the fields of Indus Valley civilisation
and Greater Indian culture. He concluded by saying that

Google
INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS, CALCUTTA, 1939 139

the historians should now co-ordinate their efforte for the
preparation of a comprehensive history of India.

The afternoon of the 15th December and the whole of
the following day were devoted to the meetings of the
different sections of the Congress of which there were as
many as five this year,

Section I.—Archaic (sic) Period (President, Prof. A. S.
Altekar).

Section IIl.—Early Imperial (sic) Period (President, Prof.
K. A. Nilakantha Sastri).

Section IIl.—Early Mediaeval Period (President, Dr.
M. Nazim).

Section IV.—Mughal Period including early Maratha-
Sikh History (President, Dr. Tarachand).

Section V.—Modern Period including later Maratha-
Sikh History (President, Prof. C. S. Srinivasachari).

The number of papers offered at the session is eloquent
of the growing popularity of the Congress. In Section] as
many as 21 papers were read, in Section II 30 papers, in
Section Ill 26 papers, in Section IV 24 papers, and in
Section V 32 papers.

By a proper observance of the time-limit for the reading
of papers it was possible to provide for discussions on the
more important of their numbers.

A notable feature of the Congress was the Historical
Exhibition which was held in the historic University Senate
Hall and was opened by the Chief Minister (Hon. Mr.
A. K. Fazlul Hug). Here was shown on proper stands

suitable show-cases a large variety of antiquities
‘ottas, sculptures, bronzes, copper-plates, coins and
paintings, belonging tothe different collections of the Univer-
sity Asutosh Museum (including the famous P. C. Nahar
and the little-known Sundarban collections) and those of
Government departments, museums, learned institutions
and private individuals. Here also was shown a large
number of documents from the Imperial Records Depart-
ments as well as the Records of the Punjab and Bengal

Governments. A fantern lecture on prehistoric India by Rao
Bahadur K. N. Dikshit on the evening of the 15th December
in the University Darbhanga Hall was another source of
attraction to the visitors. As is usual on such occasions the
business of the Congress was not neglected, there being
cone meeting of the Congress Executive which was followed
by the plenary and the concluding sessions of the Congress.
‘At these meetings among other things the Office-bearers
were elected for the following year and resolutions were
passed for exploring the avenues for financing the much-
talked of scheme of a comprehensive History of India to
be undertaken under the auspices of the Congress.

The Numismatic Society of India wisely decided to hold
ite Annual Meeting (in the University Building) along with
the session of the Indian History Congress on the 17th and
18th December. On the Ist day the President Rao
Bahadur K. N. Dikshit delivered an excellent address

year and pointed out the lines for future research. This
was followed by an informing paper on a newly—di
hoard of Satavahana coins read by Prof. V. V. Mirashi.
The second day was devoted to the reading of papers and
the business of the Society.

The authorities of the Congress arranged a varied pro-
gramme of entertainments which were appreciated by the
assembled members and delegates. These consisted of a
musical soirée at the Asutosh Hall, an enjoyable tea party
atthe garden and aviary of Dr. S.C. Law, a sumptuous
dinner party at the residence of Khan Bahadur Azizul
Haque, a steamer trip down the river and a short excursion
to the historic site of Triveni via Uttarpara and Chander-
nagore. The session was brought toa happy close by a
dinner party on the evening of the 17th December at the
palatial residence of Dr. N. N. Law. For the entertain-
ment of the guests Dr. Law tastefully decorated and illumi-
nated his house and provided charming music. The guests
were taken round his large library specially rich in its col-

lection of works and journals on In: istory and culture.
‘At the end of the dinner the President of the Congress
warmly thanked the host ina short speech to which the
latter gave a nice little reply expressing his gratification
that so many distinguished scholars graced his house by
their presence.

Altogether the 3rd Session of the Indian History Congress
proved to be a great success. The next session takes place
at Lahore on a date to be announced later.

The Greater India Society extends its most hearty con-
gratulations to its much-respected Purodha, Dr. Rabindra-
nath Tagore, on his receiving the high and well-deserved
honour of Doctorate of Literature (Honoris Causa) of the
Oxford University. The solemn ceremony of investiture
took place on the 7th August, 1940, at Santiniketan in the
presence of a distinguished gathering which included a
batch of graduates of Oxford University and the representa-
tives of Calcutta, Aligarh and Delhi Universities besides
members of the Governing Body of Dr. Tagore’s own
University, the Visva-Bharati. The proceedings started
with the chanting of some beautiful Vedic verses by Pandit
Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya and the singing of a wel-
come song by the choir of Dr. Tagore’s asrama. Then Mr.
Justice Henderson of the Calcutta High Court, in accord-
ance with the Oxford tradition, presented the poet before
Sir Maurice Gwyer (representing the Vice-Chancellor of the
University) in a Latin speech. This excellent address, of
which an English translation was read by Sir S. Radh:
krishnan, began by eulogising the services of the poet’s
talented family. It then went on to describe “‘the astonish-
ing range” of the poet's versatile genius combined with “his
essential humanity’, his famous Academy seeking to incul-
cate among the students a love of pure learning, and his
fearless criticism of the British Raj and of his fellow-citizens
‘on occasions of necessity. This was followed by a nice
little speech from Sir Maurice Gwyer formally admitting
“this most-beloved priest of the Muses” tothe coveted
‘degree. In acknowledging the high honour the poet made
a short but stirring speech in Sanskrit of which he read out
n English translation. He accepted the honour, he |, as
‘a symbol of the undying human spirit” and “amid the
present era of mounting anguish and vanishing worth”, he

NOTES AND NEWS 143

renewed his ‘faith in the perennial growth of civilisation
towards an ultimate purpose’. Sir Maurice followed with
an eloquent address in course of which he stressed the
prominence given by both the poet's and the Oxford Uni-
versity to the virtue of tolerance, ‘“‘the foundation of true
democracy’’ and after referring to the present world-crisis,
he hoped that the ultimate victory of democracy would pro-
duce “‘that true discipline of mind which alone can create
a free and tranquil world’’. He concluded with the prayer
that through the bonds which were forged that day there
might pass and repass a vital current in which the spiritual
forces of the West and the East might mingle and draw
strength from one another. A recitation in Sanskrit brought
the memorable function to a close.
We give below in extenso the above addresses : —

Honoured Sir, on whom the choice of your mother
Oxford has fallen to sit to-day in the place of the Vice-
Chancellor and Proctors, you have before you In: most
distinguished son, in whove family no more perfect illust
tion can be found of that verse of Horace: “A noble line
gives proof of noble sires".

Let me recall his grand-father, the member of a new
religious faith and a new fraternity, who was one of the first
of his countrymen to cross the estranging sea and visit the
distant land of ; his father, a religious leader of
singular rectitude and burning faith, whose piety and wis-
dom distinguished him among all hie countrymen, I recall
his gifted sister, and the first of her sex in India to attempt a
novel of Indian life; his three brothers of whom one was the
first Indian member of the Indian Civil Service, a second
was distinguished among his contemporaries in philosophy
and a third in literature and the a1 But the fourth brother
who is present before you now has by his life, his genius
and his character augmented so greatly the fame of his
house that, did his piety and modesty not forbid, none would
have a better right to say in Scipio’ jus phrase: “My
life has crowned the virtues of my line."” You see in him a
great scholar and a great artist, both in prose and in verse ;
one who has written poetry, romance, satire, history ; who
has left scarcely any field of literature untouched and has
touched nothing that he has not adorned. How rarely has
such richness of imagination been combined with such ele-
gance of style ! How astonishing is the range of his versatile
genius, wisdom and laughter, terror and delight, the power
of stirring our deepest emotions | And yet we are always
conscious of his essential humanity, of aman who thinks
nothing beneath his notice, if only it is concerned with
mankind. You see in him a musician who seems to obey no
rules and yet has invented a thousand new melodies; a
distinguished philosopher deeply versed in natural philoso-
phy, in ethics and in theology and who has at the last

achieved that complete serenity of mind sought by how
many and won by how few. Yet all dedicated as he has
been to those pursuits, he has not lived for himeelf alone ;
for deeming good education for the young the most vene-
rable of all institutions he has been the founder and director
of this famous Academy, whose purpose is by wise methods
to inculcate among its students a love of pure learning.
Let it also be said that he has not valued a sheltered
life so far above the public good as to hold himself
wholly aloof from the dust and heat of the world outside ;
for there have been times when he has not scorned to step
down into the market-place ; when, if he thought that a
wrong had been done he has not feared to challenge the
British raj itself and the authority of its magistrates ; and
when he has boldly corrected the faults of his own fellow-
citizens. What more can I say ? Here before you is the
myriad-minded poet and writer, the musician famous in his
art, the philosopher proved both in word and deed, the
fervent upholder of learning and sound doctrine, the ardent
defender of public liberties, one who by the sanctity of his
life and character has won for himself the praise of all
mankind. And so'with the unanimous approval of the Vice-
Chancellor, the Doctors, and the Masters of the University, I
present to you a man most dear to all the muses, Rabindra-
nath Tagore, already a Nobel prizeman, in order that he
may receive the laurel wreath of Oxford also and be
admitted to the Degree of Doctor of Literature honoris causa.

Delegates from Oxford University,

In honouring me, an Indian poet, your ancient seat of
learning has chosen to express its great tradition of huma-
nity. This tradition, to-day, has acquired a deeper and
more pressing significance; I feel proud to accept its
message, and the recognition it conveys. as a symbol of the
undying spirit of man. I welcome you here at Santiniketan,
and I assure you that this friendly gift that you have brought
to me and to my country, will remain in our hearts and bid
us stand together for the common cause of civilisation.

In an era of mounting anguish and vanishing worth,
when disaster is fast overtaking countries and continents,
with savagery let loose and brutal thirst for possession
augmented by science, it may sound merely poetic to speak
of any emerging principle of world-wide relations! But
Time’s violence, however immediately threatening, is cir-
cumscribed, and we who live beyond it and dwell also in the
larger reality of Time, must renew our faith in the perennial
growth of civilisation toward an ultimate purpose.

I accept this recognition from Oxford University asa
happy augury of an Age to come, and though I shall not live
to see it established, let me welcome this friendly gesture
as a promise of better days.

CONCLUDING ADDRESS BY SIR MAURICE GWYER

Sir, on behalf of the University Oxford | salute its
youngest Doctor, and I deem ita privilege indeed to have
taken part in this memorable ceremony, in which the Us
versity whose representative I am has, in honouring you,
done honour to itself. I shall not fail to convey to the
University your gracious words of acceptance, spoken in
that ancient tongue, the venerable mother from whom the
language of the University’s Address and the language which
I now speak trace alike their origin.

You Sir, belong to and have adorned a generation which

Google
NOTES AND NEWS 49

perhaps more than any other in history exalted reason and
freedom of thought; but you have ever insisted that to these
must be added other virtues, graciousness, simplicity and
the love of beauty. And have not Santiniketan and my own
University this in common, that each bases its education
upon recognition of and respect for human personality? Do
they not both attribute pre-eminence to the virtue of tole-
rance, since none can claim respect for his own personality
unless he is willing to respect that of others ? These indeed
are the foundation of true democracy, which has a
content and is something more than one of many kinds of
political mechanism; and its success has been, and will
always be, in proportion as those who live under it are
conscious of its spiritual and intellectual elements.

But in the present nightmare world the doctrines which
you and those who think with you have taught and practised
are in deadly peril ; and we are witnessing an attempt to
assassinate reason, to prescribe tolerance, and to crush the
human spirit beneath a monstrous materialism. In this
Magian conflict the liberty of the human soul iteelf is at stake
and the conflict must be fought out to the end, if darkness
is not to fall once more upon the earth. There is no compro-
mise and there is no truce in that war.

We must not doubt, unless all our most cherished beliefs
are a mockery anda cheat, what the final issue will be,
though it may not come until after much blood and many
tears. But the victory would be barren indeed, if anew
generation is not bred and confirmed in that true discipline
of mind which alone can create a free and tranquil world.
The evil men who are now harrying Europe knew their
business well when in the countries they have ravished they
singled out for destruction the Universities and ancient seats
of learning, the sanctuary and refuge of the humanities.
Though war can be waged, as this war is being waged, in
‘defence of a sublime cause, and has power to evoke some
of the noblest qualities of mankind, yet in iteelf it isan
accursed thing, and its infection will destroy civilisation

unless it is itself destroyed. But in the words which Milton
puts into the mouth of the apostate Angel,—
“twho overcomes
By force, hath overcome but half his foe",

and Apollyon must be met and conquered not on the field
of battle alone but also in that kingdom of ideas and of the
mind, where it is the teachers and philosophers who can
most effectively sustain the cause.

‘We have watched with dismay even in the years before
the war the substitution of emotion for thought and its
swift degeneration into blind and often hysterical submis-
sion to the will of a leader accountable to none but himeelf;
for unless a political society is invigorated by a multitude of
separate springs of thought and action, neither democracy
nor any system based upon the freedom of the mind can
hope to survive. Is not the clamant need of our day hard
intellectual effort and the habit of independent judgment;
courage to face realities, and not to deny the existence of
problems we are too indolent to solve; reverence for the
spirit of an ancient culture, without servility to the past or
attempts to reverse the evolutionary process? Such I believe
to be the principles which inspire your teaching in this place,
and such are those of my own University.

Sir, [thank you for your welcome. It is my earnest
prayer that through those bonds which have been forged
to-day between an ancient foundation and a new there may
pass and repass a vital current in which the spiritual forces
of the west and the east may mingle and if God will, draw
strength from one another. May the love of true learning
be ever cherished in their place; and may there ever be
granted to all their children, “hope etill to find, strength still
to climb, the spheres.””

announcing the publication of the results of archaeological

Quaritch Wales, Field-Director and Assistant Field-Director
respectively of the Greater India Research Committee.
‘This work which has appeared asa special number of the
Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society
(Vol. XVIII, Part I, February 1940) is the fruit of fourteen
months’ arduous field-work (between 1937 and 1939) in the
M States of Kedah, Perak and Johore. It was made
possible by generous grants of those States to which the
authors make grateful acknowledgments. The work
before us consists of two parts—the longer part under the
heading ‘Exploration and Research’ giving a plain narrative
of new facts brought to light by excavations, while the
shorter part summarises some of the authors’ broader de-
dyctions from these facts. Fifteen figures of maps and
plane and eighty-nine plates enhance the usefulness of this
highly important publication which has thrown new light
on a number of points relating to early Indian colonisation
of Malay. Altogether thirty sites from Kedah and two

be set ita commitments namely, the cost of publication of the
two under-mentioned works, Prof. Tucci’s Travels of Tibetan
Pilgrims in the Swat Valley and the English version of Dr. N.
J. Krom’s Hindoe-Javaansche Geschiedenis. On the receipt
side the Committee has again most gratefully to acknowledge
the kind grant of Rupees four hundred from the National
Council of Education (Bengal) and Rupees one hundred
from Dr. Narendra Nath Law, an esteemed member of the
Managing Committtee of the Society. During the period
under review receipts under the head Sale of Books and
Pamphlets amounted to Rs. 184-1-6 with which may be
compared the figure for the preceding years; Rs, 415-12-6
(1936-37), & Rs. 543-8-9 (1935-36). This serious setback is
partly to be attributed to the present international situation
and partly to the failure of the Society to get free advertise-
ments of its publications as before...On the expenditure side
the charges under Publications proved as usual to be the
heaviest item, accounting for not lese than Rs. 448-0-9 with
which may be compared the corresponding figures from the
last Annual Report namely, Rs. 911-5-0 (from Ist April 1937
to 3st December 1938). The next heaviest item consisted
of Allowances to Staff namely, Rs, 165-3-0. This included the
typist's and proof-reader’s charges for the two issues of the
Journal. This figure compares favourably with the corres-
ponding figure in the preceding report namely, Re. 208.0.0.
The postal charges during the year under review amounted
to the modest sum of Rs. 86-7-6, the corresponding figures
from the last Annual Report being Rs. 193-14-3.

Lectures

“‘As in previous years the Society arranged a number of
popular lectures in accordance with the terms of its agree-
ment with the National Council of Education, Bengal. The
range and variety of the lectures may be realised from the
under-mentioned lists: (I) Art and Archaeology in the
North-West-Frontier Province (Dr. Kalidas Nag), (2) Early
Buddhism in Burma (Dr. Nihar-Ranjan Ray), (3) Indian ,

Culture in Afghanistan (Dr. U. N. Ghoshal), (4) Indian Influ-
ences on Burmese Literature (Pandit Giris Chandra Vidya-
binode), (5 &6) Indian Influences on Burmese Monastic Life
Pandit (G. C. Vidyabinode) and (7 & 8) Indian Influences
on Burmese Social Life (Pandit G. C. Vidyabinode). To
all these gentlemen who have benefited the Society with
their lectures the Committee offers its most grateful thanks.

Publications

“Two issues of the Journal of the Society (Vol. VI, Nos, I
and 2) appeared in course of the year. The Committee notes
with satisfaction that notwithstanding the outbreak of the
European war contributions were not lacking from the pen
of leading scholars both Indian and foreign. It has also to be
mentioned that there was no falling off in the number
and variety of books sent to the Journal for review as well
as in the number of first-grade Journals on its exchange list.
All the new accessions of the Society were made over,
according to the existing arrangement, to the Calcutta Uni-
versity Library for being kept as a separate collection.
Among the publications taken in hand by the Society, the
printing of Prof. G. Tucci’s Travels of Tibetan Pilgrims in
the Swat Valley was all but completed, only the Tibetan
Text being kept by the author for correction of proofs.
Another work namely, the English translation of Prof.
Krom's Hindoe-Javaansche Geschiedenis, after being revised
by the author was sent to the translator for further improve-
ment of the language. The Committee repeats the regret ex-
pressed in the preceding Annual Report that all the Bulletins
of the Society except one continue to remain out of stock or
very nearly so. The Committee earnestly trusts that the
revised editions of these useful monographs for which there
is a steady demand might be undertaken at no distant date.

Congress and Conference

“During the last year the Society was glad to accept the
invitation from the authorities of the Tenth All-India Oriental

156 MEETING OF THE GREATER INDIA SOCIETY

Conference at Hyderabad for sending delegates to the Con-
ference. But the Conference was unfortunately postponed
‘owing to the international situation. At the third session of the
Indian Historical Congress held at Calcutta in December
last the Society was represented by a number of delegates
including Dr. U. N. Ghoshal, Mr. J. N. Banerjea and Dr.
Nihar-Ranjan Ray. All these gentlemen actively participated
in the work of the Conference, Dr. U. N. Ghoshal serving
as Secretary of one of the sections.

Conclusion

“In concluding this brief report on the working of the
Society for the last year the Committee cannot but convey
ite heart-felt thanks to those esteemed patrons and well-
wishers of the Society who have helped it in various ways.
Grateful mention has already been made of the kind help of
the authorities of the National Council of Education, Bengal,
of Dr, Narendra Nath Law and of Mr. P. K. Sen. Mention has
also been made of the valuable help given by the Editor of
The Modern Review as regards advertisement of the Society's
publications. The Committee, however, feels that funds are
urgently needed for meeting some of the Society's immediate
needs. Such specially is the need for housing the Society's
growing collection of publications. Still greater is the need
for young recruits for continuing the good work that the
Society has started on such a modest scale. The Committee
appeals to all lovers of Indian culture, Indian and foreign to
take up this work and it earnestly trusts that ite appeal will
not go in vain.'*

the editor of so sound a volume containing new and
interesting information. May it be the first of a long series,
maintaining the same high standard’.

Javanese texts, by clarifying and explaining these things,
from his knowledge of Sanskrit literature. It appears
to me that the progress of Indian writers, such as
Mr. Sarkar in this direction, that of literary text-criticiem and
detail, is most promising for the enhancement of our
knowledge of Javanese literature." (Translated)

Dr. M. Winternitz in course of a long review in Archiv
Orientalni, (viii, 2, 1936) writes: —

“Mr. Sarkar’s is the first comprehensive attempt of
viewing the problem of Indian influences on the literature
of Java and Bali from the point of view of the history
of Sanskrit literature and Indian culture......!
Indologist who wishes to follow up the facts of Indian
literary achievements on their wanderings outside India,
but also the ethnologist to whom the study of mixture of
cultures is a subject of intrinsic interest, will find Mr.
Sarkar's book an excellent guide through the maze of
Indo-Indonesian cultural relations. We hope this valuable
publication which appears as No.1 of the Greater India
Society's new series of “‘Greater India Studies,” may
soon be followed by other as interesting studies

, Dr. George Qoedés writes in the Bulletin Frangaise
d’extreme Orient (Ixxxiv, no- 2):

“The author passes successively in review the diverse
branches of this literature giving in afew cases sufficient
detailed summaries of the principal texts. On this point
the author has done real service not only to his compatriots
desirous of knowing the expansion of their national literature,
but aleo to those who do not read Dutch."’ (Translated).
